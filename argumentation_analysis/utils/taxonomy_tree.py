"""The taxonomy's parent relation, read from its ``path`` encoding (#2401).

The Argumentum CSV encodes its tree in ``path``: a dotted path's parent drops
its last segment (``"1.2.3"`` -> ``"1.2"``). The depth-1 nodes are the one case
the prefix rule cannot express: they carry a bare segment (``"1"``, ``"2"``...),
not ``"0.1"``, and their parent is the depth-0 root (``PK 0``, ``path "0"``).

Every child rule over the taxonomy reads the relation here. The local
``startswith(path + ".")`` rule found nothing under the root, and pairing it
with ``depth == parent_depth + 1`` lost the one row whose ``depth`` cell
disagrees with its path.
