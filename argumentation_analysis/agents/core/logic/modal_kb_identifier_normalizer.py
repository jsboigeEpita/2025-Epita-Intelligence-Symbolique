"""Modal KB identifier normalization (#1326, builds on #1260/#1230).

Tweety's ``MlParser`` grammar is *stricter* than the propositional parser: a
predicate/sort declaration must match ``[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*`` — underscores and
other separators are rejected with::

    ParserException: Illegal characters in predicate definition 'joke_teleprompter';
                      declaration must conform to [a-z,A-Z]([a-z,A-Z,0-9])*

Several modal-KB producers emit underscored multi-word atoms (LLM-generated
identifiers such as ``joke_teleprompter``, the spectacular-path
``_construct_modal_kb_from_json``). Such a KB never parses, so consistency is
never decided and the modal axis degrades to honest ``None`` (the R519
firsthand-reproduced failure: 3/3 modal axes undecided).

This module maps every MlParser-illegal atom to a fresh legal identifier and is
applied at the parse point (``ModalHandler``, immediately *amont* de
``parseBeliefBase``) so EVERY caller is protected regardless of upstream
producer — defense-in-depth. The transform:

* PascalCase join on non-alphanumeric splits: ``joke_teleprompter`` →
  ``JokeTeleprompter`` (the semantic stem survives, only the separators drop).
* generic ``MpAtomN`` fallback when the stem is empty/illegal.
* applied **consistently** to declarations and bodies, and the collision set
  tracks *generated* candidates too — so two distinct source atoms that
  PascalCase to the same stem (``heavy_rain`` vs ``heavy-rain``) are
  disambiguated instead of collapsed. That soundness guard was absent from the
  original inline #1260 closure.

Anti-pendule: this normalizes the **syntax** of the sort-name for Tweety only;
it does not neutralize semantic content or variance. No heuristic masks a
parse-fail — a genuinely malformed KB is still rejected and the handler returns
honest ``None`` (#1019 fail-loud). It is idempotent on already-legal atoms, so a
caller that pre-sanitizes (the nl path via ``invoke_callables._legal_symbol``)
is unaffected by the second pass here.
