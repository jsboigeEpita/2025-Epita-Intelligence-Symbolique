Title: Advances in Natural Language Processing for Argument Analysis
Authors: J. Smith, A. Johnson, M. Williams

Abstract:
This paper presents a novel approach to argument analysis using advanced natural language processing techniques. We propose a framework that combines transformer-based models with traditional linguistic analysis to identify and extract argumentative structures from political speeches and debates. Our results show significant improvements over previous methods, with a 15% increase in precision and recall for argument component identification.

Keywords: natural language processing, argument mining, political discourse

Introduction:
The analysis of argumentative structures in political discourse has gained significant attention in recent years. With the proliferation of digital media and the increasing availability of political speeches and debates in textual form, there is a growing need for automated methods to extract and analyze arguments.

Methodology
In this study, we employed a mixed-methods approach combining qualitative content analysis with quantitative computational methods. We collected a corpus of 500 political speeches from various sources, spanning the period from 2010 to 2020. The speeches were preprocessed to remove non-textual elements and normalized for further analysis.

Our framework consists of three main components:
1. A BERT-based sequence labeling model for identifying argument components
2. A relation classification module for detecting argumentative relations
3. A post-processing step to reconstruct the complete argumentative structure

The model was trained on a manually annotated dataset of 100 speeches and validated on a separate set of 50 speeches.

Results
The evaluation of our approach shows promising results. The argument component identification achieved an F1-score of 0.78, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 15%. The relation classification module achieved an accuracy of 0.72, which is comparable to human annotator agreement on this task.

Table 1 shows the detailed performance metrics for different argument components:

| Component Type | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|---------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Claim         | 0.82      | 0.75   | 0.78     |
| Premise       | 0.76      | 0.79   | 0.77     |
| Rebuttal      | 0.68      | 0.65   | 0.66     |

Discussion:
The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in automatically extracting argumentative structures from political speeches. The combination of transformer-based models with linguistic features proved particularly effective for identifying complex argumentative patterns.

Conclusion
This study contributes to the field of argument mining by proposing a novel framework for analyzing political discourse. The improved performance of our approach enables more accurate and comprehensive analysis of argumentative structures in political speeches, which can benefit various applications in political science, communication studies, and public policy analysis.

Future work will focus on extending the framework to handle multi-modal data and cross-lingual argument analysis.
