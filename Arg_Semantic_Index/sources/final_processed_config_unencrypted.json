He also charged Lincoln had been present when a very radical “abolitionist” type platform had been written by the Republican Party in 1854. Douglas accused Lincoln of taking the side of the common enemy in the Mexican War. Douglas also said Lincoln wanted to make Illinois “a free Negro colony.” Douglas asked Lincoln seven questions.\n\nLincoln during his turn did not respond to the questions and was on the defensive denying the allegations Douglas had made. Lincoln charged Douglas with trying to nationalize slavery.\n\nIn his rebuttal Douglas concentrated on the charge that Lincoln had been present when a very radical “abolitionist” type platform had been written by the Republican Party in 1854.\n\nSource: Neely, Mark E. Jr. 1982. _The Abraham Lincoln Encyclopedia_. New York: Da Capo Press, Inc.\n\nFull text of the Ottawa Debate follows.\n\n**Mr. Douglas' Speech**\n\nLadies and gentlemen: I appear before you to-day for the purpose of discussing the leading political topics which now agitate the public mind. By an arrangement between Mr. Lincoln and myself, we are present here to-day for the purpose of having a joint discussion, as the representatives of the two great political parties of the State and Union, upon the principles in issue between those parties and this vast concourse of people, shows the deep feeling which pervades the public mind in regard to the questions dividing us.\n\nPrior to 1854 this country was divided into two great political parties, known as the Whig and Democratic parties. Both were national and patriotic, advocating principles that were universal in their application. An old line Whig could proclaim his principles in Louisiana and Massachusetts alike. Whig principles had no boundary sectional line, they were not limited by the Ohio river, nor by the Potomac, nor by the line of the free and slave States, but applied and were proclaimed wherever the Constitution ruled or the American flag waved over the American soil. (Hear him, and three cheers.) So it was, and so it is with the great Democratic party, which, from the days of Jefferson until this period, has proven itself to be the historic party of this nation. While the Whig and Democratic parties differed in regard to a bank, the tariff, distribution, the specie circular and the sub-treasury, they agreed on the great slavery question which now agitates the Union. I say that the Whig party and the Democratic party agreed on this slavery question, while they differed on those matters of expediency to which I have referred. The Whig party and the Democratic party jointly adopted the Compromise measures of 1850 as the basis of a proper and just solution of this slavery question in all its forms. Clay was the great leader, with Webster on his right and Cass on his left, and sustained by the patriots in the Whig and Democratic ranks, who had devised and enacted the Compromise measures of 1850.\n\nIn 1851, the Whig party and the Democratic party united in Illinois in adopting resolutions indorsing and approving the principles of the Compromise measures of 1850, as the proper adjustment of that question. In 1852, when the Whig party assembled in Convention at Baltimore for the purpose of nominating a candidate for the Presidency, the first thing it did was to declare the Compromise measures of 1850, in substance and in principle, a suitable adjustment of that question. (Here the speaker was interrupted by loud and long continued applause.) My friends, silence will be more acceptable to me in the discussion of these questions than applause. I desire to address myself to your judgment, your understanding, and your consciences, and not to your passions or your enthusiasm. When the Democratic Convention assembled in Baltimore in the same year, for the purpose of nominating a Democratic candidate for the Presidency, it also adopted the compromise measures of 1850 as the basis of Democratic action. Thus you see that up to 1853-'54, the Whig party and the Democratic party both stood on the same platform with regard to the slavery question. That platform was the right of the people of each State and each Territory to decide their local and domestic institutions for themselves, subject only to the federal constitution.\n\nDuring the session of Congress of 1853-'54, I introduced into the Senate of the United States a bill to organize the Territories of Kansas and Nebraska on that principle which had been adopted in the compromise measures of 1850, approved by the Whig party and the Democratic party in Illinois in 1851, and endorsed by the Whig party and the Democratic party in national convention in 1852. In order that there might be no misunderstanding in relation to the principle involved in the Kansas and Nebraska bill, I put forth the true intent and meaning of the act in these words: \"It is the true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any State or Territory, or to exclude it therefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the federal constitution.\" Thus, you see, that up to 1854, when the Kansas and Nebraska bill was brought into Congress for the purpose of carrying out the principles which both parties had up to that time endorsed and approved, there had been no division in this country in regard to that principle except the opposition of the abolitionists. In the House of Representatives of the Illinois Legislature, upon a resolution asserting that principle, every Whig and every Democrat in the House voted in the affirmative, and only four men voted against it, and those four were old line Abolitionists. (Cheers.)\n\nIn 1854, Mr. Abraham Lincoln and Mr. Trumbull entered into an arrangement, one with the other, and each with his respective friends, to dissolve the old Whig party on the one hand, and to dissolve the old Democratic party on the other, and to connect the members of both into an Abolition party under the name and disguise of a Republican party. (Laughter and cheers, hurrah for Douglas.) The terms of that arrangement between Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Trumbull have been published to the world by Mr. Lincoln's special friend, James H. Matheny, Esq., and they were, that Lincoln should have Shields's place in the U. S. Senate, which was then about to become vacant, and that Trumbull should have my seat when my term expired. (Great Laughter.) Lincoln went to work to abolitionize the Old Whig party all over the State, pretending that he was then as good a Whig as ever; (laughter) and Trumbull went to work in his part of the State preaching Abolitionism in its milder and lighter form, and trying to abolitionize the Democratic party, and bring old Democrats handcuffed and bound hand and foot into the Abolition camp. (\"Good,\" \"hurrah for Douglas,\" and cheers.) In pursuance of the arrangement, the parties met at Springfield in October, 1854, and proclaimed their new platform. Lincoln was to bring into the Abolition camp the old line Whigs, and transfer them over to Giddings, Chase, Fred Douglass, and Parson Lovejoy, who were ready to receive them and christen them in their new faith. (Laughter and cheers.) They laid down on that occasion a platform for their new Republican party, which was to be thus constructed. I have the resolutions of their State Convention then held, which was the first mass State Convention ever held in Illinois by the Black Republican party, and I now hold them in my hands and will read a part of them, and cause the others to be printed. Here are the most important and material resolutions of this Abolition platform:\n\n_1. Resolved_, That we believe this truth to be self-evident, that when parties become subversive of the ends for which they are established, or incapable of restoring the government to the true principles of the constitution, it is the right and duty of the people to dissolve the political bands by which they may have been connected therewith, and to organize new parties upon such principles and with such views as the circumstances and exigencies of the nation may demand.\n\n_2. Resolved_, That the times imperatively demand the reorganization of parties, and repudiating all previous party attachments, names and predilections, we unite ourselves together in defense of the liberty and constitution of the country, and will hereafter co-operate as the Republican party, pledged to the accomplishment of the following purposes: to bring the administration of the government back to the control of first principles; to restore Nebraska and Kansas to the position of free Territories; that, as the constitution of the United States, vests in the States, and not in Congress, the power to legislate for the extradition of fugitives from labor, to repeal and entirely abrogate the fugitive slave law; to restrict slavery to those States in which it exists; to prohibit the admission of any more slave States into the Union; to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia; to exclude slavery from all the territories over which the general government has exclusive jurisdiction; and to resist the acquirements of any more Territories unless the practice of slavery therein forever shall have been prohibited.\n\n_3. Resolved_, That in furtherance of these principles we will use such constitutional and lawful means as shall seem best adapted to their accomplishment, and that we will support no man for office, under the general or State Government, who is not positively and fully committed to the support of these principles, and whose personal character and conduct is not a guaranty that he is reliable, and who shall not have abjured old party allegiance and ties.\n\n(The resolutions, as they were read, were cheered throughout.)\n\nNow, gentlemen, your Black Republicans have cheered every one of those propositions, (\"good and cheers, \") and yet I venture to say that you cannot get Mr. Lincoln to come out and say that he is now in favor of each one of them. (Laughter and applause. \"Hit him again.) That these propositions, one and all, constitute the platform of the Black Republican party of this day, I have no doubt; (\"good\") and when you were not aware for what purpose I was reading them, your Black Republicans cheered them as good Black Republican doctrines. (\"That's it,\" etc.) My object in reading these resolutions, was to put the question to Abraham Lincoln this day, whether he now stands and will stand by each article in that creed and carry it out. (\"Good.\" \"Hit him again.\") I desire to know whether Mr. Lincoln today stands as he did in 1854, in favor of the unconditional repeal of the fugitive slave law. I desire him to answer whether he stands pledged to-day, as he did in 1854, against the admission of any more slave States into the Union, even if the people want them. I want to know whether he stands pledged against the admission of a new State into the Union with such a Constitution as the people of that State may see fit to make. (\"That's ot;\" \"put it at him.\") I want to know whether he stands today pledged to the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia. I desire him to answer whether he stands pledged to the prohibition of the slave trade between the different States. (\"He does.\") I desire to know whether he stands pledged to prohibit slavery in all the territories of the United States, North as well as South of the Missouri Compromise line, (\"Kansas too.\") I desire him to answer whether he is opposed to the acquisition of any more territory unless slavery is prohibited therein. I want his answer to these questions. Your affirmative cheers in favor of this Abolition platform is not satisfactory. I ask Abraham Lincoln to answer these questions, in order that when I trot him down to lower Egypt, I may put the same questions to him. (Enthusiastic applause.) My principles are the same everywhere. (Cheers and \"hark.\") I can proclaim them alike in the North, the South, the East, and the West. My principles will apply wherever the Constitution prevails and the American flag waves. (\"Good\" and applause.) I desire to know whether Mr. Lincoln's principles will bear transplanting from Ottawa to Jonesboro? I put these questions to him to-day distinctly, and ask an answer. I have a right to an answer, for I quote from the platform of the Republican party, made by himself and others at the time that party was formed, and the bargain made by Lincoln to dissolve and kill the old Whig party, and transfer its members, bound hand and foot, to the Abolition party, under the direction of Giddings and Fred Douglass. (Cheers.) In the remarks I have made on this platform, and the position of Mr. Lincoln upon it, I mean nothing personally disrespectful or unkind to that gentleman. I have known him for nearly twenty-five years. There were many points of sympathy between us when we first got acquainted. We were both comparatively boys, and both struggling with poverty in a strange land. I was a school-teacher in the town of Winchester, and he a flourishing grocery-keeper in the town of Salem. (Applause and laughter.) He was more successful in his occupation than I was in mine, and hence more fortunate in this world's goods. Lincoln is one of those peculiar men who perform with admirable skill everything which they undertake. I made as good a schoolteacher as I could, and when a cabinet maker I made a good bedstead and tables, although my old boss said I succeeded better with bureaus and secretaries than with anything else; (cheers,) but I believe that Lincoln was always more successful in business than I, for his business enabled him to get into the Legislature. I met him there, however, and had sympathy with him, because of the up-hill struggle we both had in life. He was then just as good at telling an anecdote as now. (\"No doubt.\") He could beat any of the boys wrestling, or running a foot-race, in pitching quoits or tossing a copper; could ruin more liquor than all the boys of the town together, (uproarious laughter,) and the dignity and impartiality with which he presided at a horse-race or fist-fight, excited the admiration and won the praise of everybody that was present and participated. (Renewed laughter.) I symphathised with him, because he was struggling with difficulties, and so was I. Mr. Lincoln served with me in the Legislature in 1836, when we both retired, and he subsided, or became submerged, and he was lost sight of as a public man for some years. In 1846, when Wilmot introduced his celebrated proviso, and the Abolition tornado swept over the country; Lincoln again turned up as a member of Congress from the Sangamon district. I was then in the Senate of the United States, and was glad to welcome my old friend and companion. Whilst in Congress, he distinguished himself by his opposition to the Mexican war, taking the side of the common enemy against his own country; (\"that's true,\") and when he returned home he found that the indignation of the people followed him everywhere, and he was again submerged or obliged to retire into private life, forgotten by his former friends. (\"And will be again.\") He came up again in 1854, just in time to make this Abolition or Black Republican platform, in company with Giddings, Lovejoy, Chase and Fred Douglass, for the Republican party to sand upon. (Laughter, \"Hit him again,\" &c.)Trumbull, too, was one of our own contemporaries. He was born and raised in old Connecticut, was bred a Federalist, but removing to Georgia, turned Nullifier, when nullification was popular, and as soon as he disposed of his clocks and wound up his business, migrated to Illinois, (laughter,) turned politician and lawyer here, and made his appearance in 1841, as a member of the Legislature. He became noted as the author of the scheme to repudiate a large portion of the State debt of Illinois, which, if successful, would have brought infamy and disgrace upon the fair escutcheon of our glorious State. The odium attached to that measure consigned him to oblivion for a time. I helped to do it. I walked into a public meeting in the hall of the House of Representatives, and replied to his repudiating speeches, and resolutions were carried over his head denouncing repudiation, and asserting the moral and legal obligation of Illinois to pay every dollar of the debt she owed and every bond that bore her seal. (\"Good,\" and cheers.) Trumbull's malignity has followed me since I thus defeated his infamous scheme.\n\nThese two men having formed this combination to abolitionize the old Whig party and the old Democratic party, and put themselves into the Senate of the Untied States, in pursuance of their bargain, are now carrying out that arrangement. Matheny states that Trumbull broke faith; that the bargain was that Lincoln should be the Senator in Shields's place, and Trumbull was to wait for mine; (laughter and cheers,) and the story goes, that Trumbull cheated Lincoln, having control of four or five abolitionized Democrats who were holding over in the Senate; he would not let them vote for Lincoln, and which obliged the rest of the Abolitionists to support him in order to secure an Abolition Senator. There are a number of authorities for the truth of this besides Matheny, and I suppose that even Mr. Lincoln will not deny it. (Applause and laughter.)\n\nMr. Lincoln demands that he shall have the place intended for Trumbull, as Trumbull cheated him and got his, and Trumbull is stumping the State traducing me for the purpose of securing the position for Lincoln, in order to quiet him. (\"Lincoln can never get it, &c.\") It was in consequence of this arrangement that the Republican Convention was impanneled to instruct for Lincoln and nobody else, and it was on this account that they passed resolutions that he was their first, their last, and their only choice. Archy Williams was nowhere, Browning was nobody, Wentworth was not to be considered; they had no man in the Republican party for the place except Lincoln, for the reason that he demanded that they should carry out the arrangement. (\"Hit him again.\")\n\nHaving formed this new party for the benefit of deserters from Whiggery, and deserters from Democracy, and having laid down the Abolition platform which I have read, Lincoln now takes his stand and proclaims his Abolition doctrines. Let me read a part of them. In his speech at Springfield to the Convention, which nominated him for the Senate, he said:\n\n\"In my opinion it will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed. 'A house divided against itself cannot stand.' I believe this government _cannot endure permanently half Slave and half Free_. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved-I do not expect the house to fall - _but I do expect it will cease to be divided_. It will become all one thing, or all the other. Either the opponents of slavery _will arrest the further spread of it_, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief _that it is in the course of ultimate extinction:_ or its advocates _will push it forward till it shall became alike lawful in all the States_-old as well as new, North as well as South.\"\n\n(\"Good,\" \"good,\" and cheers.)\n\nI am delighted to hear you Black Republicans say \"good.\" (Laughter and cheers.) I have no doubt that doctrine expresses your sentiments (\"hit them again,\" \"that's it,\") and I will prove to you now, if you will listen to me, that it is revolutionary and destructive of the existence of this Government. (\"Hurrah for Douglas,\" \"good,\" and cheers.) Mr. Lincoln, in the extract from which I have read, says that this Government cannot endure permanently in the same condition in which it was made by its framers-divided into free and slave States. He says that it has existed for about seventy years thus divided, and yet he tells you that it cannot endure permanently on the same principles and in the same relative condition in which our fathers made it. Why can it not exist divided into free and slave States? Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, Madison, Hamilton, Jay, and the great men of that day, made this Government divided into free States and slave States, and left each State perfectly free to do as it pleased on the subject of slavery. (\"Right, right.\") Why can it not exist on the same principles on which our fathers made it? (\"It can.\")The knew when they framed the Constitution that in a country as wide and broad as this, with such a variety of climate, production and interest, the people necessarily required different laws and institutions in different localities. They knew that the laws and regulations which would suit the granite hills of New Hampshire would be unsuited to the rice plantations of South Carolina, (\"right, right,\") and they, therefore, provided that each State should retain its own Legislature and its own sovereignty, with the full and complete power to do as it pleased within its own limits, in all that was local and not national. (Applause.) One of the reserved rights of the States, was the right to regulate the relations between Master and Servant, on the slavery question. At the time the Constitution was framed, there were thirteen States in the Union, twelve of which were slaveholding States and one free State. Suppose this doctrine of uniformity preached by Mr. Lincoln, that the States should all be free or all be slave had prevailed, and what would have been the result? Of course, the twelve slaveholding States would have overruled the one free State, and slavery would have been fastened by a Constitutional provision on every inch of the American Republic, instead of being left as our fathers wisely left it, to each State to decide for itself. (\"Good, good,\" and three cheers for Douglas.) Here I assert that uniformity in the local laws and institutions of the different States in neither possible or desirable. If uniformity had been adopted when the Government was established, it must inevitably have been the uniformity of slavery everywhere, or else the uniformity of negro citizenship and negro equality everywhere.\n\nWe are told by Lincoln that he is utterly opposed to the Dred Scott decision, and will not submit to it, for the reason that he says it deprives the negro of the rights and privileges of citizenship. (Laughter and applause.) That is the first and main reason which he assigns for his warfare on the Supreme Court of the United Sates and its decision. I ask you, are you in favor of conferring upon the negro the rights and privileges of citizenship? (\"No, no.\") Do you desire to strike out of our State Constitution that clause which keeps slaves and free negroes out of the State, and allow the free negroes to flow in, (\"never,\") and cover your prairies with black settlements? Do you desire to turn this beautiful State into a free negro colony, (\"no, no,\") in order that when Missouri abolishes slavery she can send one hundred thousand emancipated slaves into Illinois, to become citizens and voters, on an equality with yourselves? (\"Never,\" \"no.\") If you desire negro citizenship, if you desire to allow them to come into the State and settle with the white man, if you desire them to vote on an equality with yourselves, and to make them eligible to office, to serve on juries, and to adjudge your rights, then support Mr. Lincoln and the Black Republican party, who are in favor of the citizenship of the negro. (\"Never, never.\") For one, I am opposed to negro citizenship in any and every form. (Cheers.) I believe this Government was made on the white basis. (\"Good.\") I believe it was made by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity for ever, and I am in favor of confining citizenship to white men, men of European birth and descent, instead of conferring it upon negroes, Indians, and other inferior races. (\"Good for you.\" \"Douglas forever.\")\n\nMr. Lincoln, following the example and lead of all the little Abolition orators, who go around and lecture in the basements of schools and churches, reads from the Declaration of Independence, that all men were created equal, and then asks, how can you deprive a negro of that equality which God and the Declaration of Independence awards to him? He and they maintain that negro equality is guarantied by the laws of God, and that it is asserted in the Declaration of Independence. If they think so, of course they have a right to say so, and so vote. I do not question Mr. Lincoln's conscientious belief that the negro was made his equal, and hence is his brother, (laughter,) but for my own part, I do not regard the negro as my equal, and positively deny that he is my brother or any kin to me whatever. (\"Never.\" \"Hit him again,\" and cheers.) Lincoln has evidently learned by heart Parson Lovejoy's catechism. (Laughter and applause.) He can repeat it as well as Farnsworth, and he is worthy of a medal from Father Giddings and Fred Douglass for his Abolitionism. (Laughter.) He holds that the negro was born his equal and yours, and that he was endowed with equality by the Almighty, and that no human law can deprive him of these rights which were guarantied to him by the Supreme ruler of the Universe. Now, I do not believe that the Almighty ever intended the negro to be the equal of the white man. (\"Never, never.\") If he did, he has been a long time demonstrating the fact. (Cheers.) For thousands of years the negro has been a race upon the earth, and during all that time, in all latitudes and climates, wherever he has wandered or been taken, he has been inferior to the race which he has there met. He belongs to an inferior race, and must always occupy an inferior position. (\"Good,\" \"that's so,\" &c.) I do not hold that because the negro is our inferior that therefore he ought to be a slave. By no means can such a conclusion be drawn from what I have said. On the contrary, I hold that humanity and Christianity both require that the negro shall have and enjoy every right, every privilege, and every immunity consistent with the safety of the society in which he lives. (That's so.) On that point, I presume, there can be no diversity of opinion. You and I are bound to extend to our inferior and dependent beings every right, every privilege, every facility and immunity consistent with the public good. The question then arises, what rights and privileges are consistent with the public good? This is a question which each State and each Territory must decide for itself-Illinois has decided it for herself. We have provided that the negro shall not be a slave, and we have also provided that he shall not be a citizen, but protect him in his civil rights, in his life, his person and his property, only depriving him of all political rights whatsoever, and refusing to put him on an equality with the white man. (\"Good.\") That policy of Illinois is satisfactory to the Democratic party and to me, and if it were to the Republicans, there would then be no question upon the subject; but the Republicans say that he ought to be made a citizen, and when he becomes a citizen he becomes your equal, with all your rights and privileges. (\"He never shall.\") They assert the Dred Scott decision to be monstrous because it denies that the negro is or can be a citizen under the Constitution. Now, I hold that Illinois had a right to abolish and prohibit slavery as she did, and I hold that Kentucky has the same right to continue and protect slavery that Illinois had to abolish it. I hold that New York had as much right to abolish slavery as Virginia has to continue it, and that each and every State of this Union is a sovereign power, with the right to do as it pleases upon this question of slavery, and upon all its domestic institutions. Slavery is not the only question which comes up in this controversy. There is a far more important one to you, and that is, what shall be done with the free negro? We have settled the slavery question as far as we are concerned; we have prohibited it in Illinois forever, and in doing so, I think we have done wisely, and there is no man in the State who would be more strenuous in his opposition to the introduction of slavery than I would; (cheers) but when we settled it for ourselves, we exhausted all our power over that subject. We have done our whole duty, and can do no more. We must leave each and every other State to decide for itself the same question. In relation to the policy to be pursued toward the free negroes, we have said that they shall not vote; whilst Maine, on the other hand, has said that they shall vote. Maine is a sovereign State, and has the power to regulate the qualifications of voters within her limits. I would never consent to confer the right of voting and of citizenship upon a negro, but still I am not going to quarrel with Maine for differing from me in opinion. Let Maine take care of her own negroes and fix the qualifications of her own voters to suit herself, without interfering with Illinois, and Illinois will not interfere with Maine. So with the State of New York. She allows the negro to vote provided he owns two hundred and fifty dollars' worth of property, but not otherwise. While I would not make any distinction whatever between a negro who held property and one who did not; yet if the sovereign State of New York chooses to make that distinction it is her business and not mine, and I will not quarrel with her for it. She can do as she pleases on this question if she minds her own business, and we will do the same thing. Now, my friends, if we will only act conscientiously and rigidly upon this great principle of popular sovereignty, which guaranties to each State and Territory the right to do as it pleases on all things, local and domestic, instead of Congress interfering, we will continue at peace one with another. Why should Illinois be at war with Missouri, or Kentucky with Ohio, or Virginia with New York, merely because their institutions differ? Our fathers intended that our institutions should differ. They knew that the North and the South, having different climates, productions and interests, required different institutions. This doctrine of Mr. Lincoln, of uniformity among the institutions of the different States, is a new doctrine, never dreamed of by Washington, Madison, or the framers of this Government. Mr. Lincoln and the Republican party set themselves up as wiser than these men who made this Government, which has flourished for seventy years under the principle of popular sovereignty, recognizing the right of each State to do as it pleased. Under that principle, we have grown from a nation of three or four millions to a nation of about thirty millions of people; we have crossed the Allegheny mountains and filled up the whole North-west, turning the prairie into a garden, and building up churches and schools, thus spreading civilization and Christianity where before there was nothing but savage barbarism. Under that principle we have become, from a feeble nation, the most powerful on the face of the earth, and if we only adhere to that principle, we can go forward increasing in territory, in power, in strength and in glory until the Republic of America shall be the North Star that shall guide the friends of freedom throughout the civilized world. (\"Long may you live,\" and great applause.) And why can we not adhere to the great principle of self-government, upon which our institutions were originally based. (\"We can.\") I believe that this new doctrine preached by Mr. Lincoln and his party will dissolve the Union if it succeeds. They are trying to array all the Northern States in one body against the South, to excite a sectional war between the free States and the slave States, in order that the one or the other may be driven to the wall.\n\nI am told that my time is out. Mr. Lincoln will now address you for an hour and a half, and I will then occupy an half hour in replying to him.\n\n**Mr. Lincoln's Speech**\n\nMr. Lincoln then came forward and was greeted with loud and protracted cheers from fully two-thirds of the audience. This was admitted by the Douglas men on the platform. It was some minutes before he could make himself heard, even by those on the stand. At last he said:\n\nMY FELLOW-CITIZENS: When a man hears himself somewhat misrepresented, it provokes him-at least, I find it so with myself; but when misrepresentation becomes very gross and palpable, it is more apt to amuse him. The first thing I see fit to notice, is the fact that Judge Douglas alleges, after running through the history of the old Democratic and the old Whig parties, that Judge Trumbull and myself made an arrangement in 1854, by which I was to have the place of Gen. Shields in the United States Senate, and Judge Trumbull was to have the place of Judge Douglas. Now, all I have to say upon that subject is, that I think no man-not even Judge Douglas-can prove it, _because it is not true_. [Cheers.] I have no doubt he is \"_conscientious_\" in saying it. [Laughter.] As to those resolutions that he took such a length of time to read, as being the platform of the Republican party in 1854, I say I never had anything to do with them, and I think Trumbull never had. [Renewed laughter.] Judge Douglas cannot show that either of us ever did have anything to do with them. I believe _this_ is true about those resolutions: There was a call for a Convention to form a Republican party at Springfield, and I think that my friend, Mr. Lovejoy, who is here upon this stand, had a hand in it. I think this is true, and I think if he will remember accurately, he will be able to recollect that he tried to get me into it, and I would not go in. [Cheers and laughter.] I believe it is also true that I went away from Springfield when the Convention was in session, to attend court in Tazewell county. It is true they did place my name, though without authority, upon the committee, and afterward wrote me to attend the meeting of the committee, but I refused to do so, and I never had anything to do with that organization. This is the plain truth about all that matter of the resolutions.\n\nNow, about this story that Judge Douglas tells of Trumbull bargaining to sell out the old Democratic party, and Lincoln agreeing to sell out the old Whig party, I have the means of _knowing_ about that; Judge Douglas cannot have; and I know there is no substance to it whatever. Yet I have no doubt he is \"_conscientious_\" about it. I know that after Mr. Lovejoy got into the Legislature that winter, he complained of me that I had told all the old Whigs of his district that the old Whig party was good enough for them, and some of them voted against him because I told them so. Now, I have no means of totally disproving such charges as this which the Judge makes. A man cannot prove a negative, but he has a right to claim that when a man makes an affirmative charge, he must offer some proof to show the truth of what he says. I certainly cannot introduce testimony to show the negative about things, but I have a right to claim that if a man says he _knows_ a thing, then he must show _how_ he knows it. I always have a right to claim this, and it is not satisfactory to me that he may be \"conscientious\" on the subject. [Cheers and Laughter.]\n\nNow, gentlemen, I hate to waste my time on such things, but in regard to that general Abolition tilt that Judge Douglas makes, when he says that I was engaged at that time in selling out and abolitionizing the old Whig party-I hope you will permit me to read a part of a printed speech that I made then at Peoria, which will show altogether a different view of the position I took in that contest of 1854.\n\nVOICE-\"Put on your specs.\"\n\nMR. LINCOLN-Yes, sir, I am obliged to do so. I am no longer a young man. [Laughter.]\n\n\"This is the _repeal_ of the Missouri Compromise. The foregoing history may not be precisely accurate in every particular; but I am sure it is sufficiently so for all the uses I shall attempt to make of it, and in it we have before us, the chief materials enabling us to correctly judge whether the repeal of the Missouri Compromise is right or wrong.\n\n\"I think, and shall try to show, that it is wrong; wrong in its direct effect, letting slavery into Kansas and Nebraska-and wrong in its prospective principle, allowing it to spread to every other part of the wide world, where men can be found inclined to take it.\n\n\"This _declared_ indifference, but, as I must think, covert real zeal for the spread of slavery, I cannot but hate. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world-enables the enemies of free institutions, with plausibility, to taunt us as hypocrites-causes the real friends of freedom to doubt our sincerity, and especially because it forces so many really good men amongst ourselves into an open war with the very fundamental principles of civil liberty-criticizing the Declaration of Independence, and insisting that there is no right principle of action but _self-interest_.\n\n\"Before proceeding, let me say I think I have no prejudice against the Southern people. They are just what we would be in their situation. If slavery did not now exist among them, they would not introduce it. If it did now exist amongst us, we should not instantly give it up. This I believe of the masses North and South. Doubtless there are individuals on both sides, who would not hold slaves under any circumstances; and others who would gladly introduce slavery anew, if it were out of existence. We know that some Southern men do free their slaves, go North, and become tiptop Abolitionists; while some Northern ones go South, and become most cruel slave-masters.\n\n\"When Southern people tell us they are no more responsible for the origin of slavery than we, I acknowledge the fact. When it is said that the institution exists, and that it is very difficult to get rid of it, in any satisfactory way, I can understand and appreciate the saying. I surely will not blame them for not doing what I should not know how to do myself. If all earthly power were given me, I should not know what to do, as to the existing institution. My first impulse would be to free all the slaves, and send them to Liberia,-to their own native land. But a moment's reflection would convince me, that whatever of high hope, (as I think there is) there may be in this, in the long run, its sudden execution is impossible. If they were all landed there in a day, they would all perish in the next ten days; and there are not surplus shipping and surplus money enough in the world to carry them there in many times ten days. What then? Free them all, and keep them among us as underlings? Is it quite certain that this betters their condition? I think I would not hold one in slavery at any rate; yet the point is not clear enough to me to denounce people upon. What next? Free them, and make them politically and socially our equals? My own feelings will not admit of this; and if mine would, we well know that those of the great mass of white people will not. Whether this feeling accords with justice and sound judgment, is not the sole question, if, indeed, it is any part of it. A universal feeling, whether well or ill-founded, cannot be safely disregarded. We cannot, then, make them equals. It does seem to me that systems of gradual emancipation might be adopted; but for their tardiness in this, I will not undertake to judge our brethren of the South.\n\n\"When they remind us of their constitutional rights, I acknowledge them, not grudgingly, but fully and fairly; and I would give them any legislation for the reclaiming of their fugitives, which should not, in its stringency, be more likely to carry a free man into slavery, than our ordinary criminal laws are to hang an innocent one.\n\n\"But all this, to my judgment, furnishes no more excuse for permitting slavery to go into our own free territory, than it would for reviving the African slave-trade by law. The law which forbids the bringing of slaves _from_ Africa, and that which has so long forbid the taking of them _to_ Nebraska, can hardly be distinguished on any moral principle; and the repeal of the former could find quite as plausible excuses as that of the latter.\"\n\nI have reason to know that Judge Douglas _knows_ that I said this. I think he has the answer here to one of the questions he put to me. I do not mean to allow him to catechise me unless he pays back for it in kind. I will not answer questions one after another, unless he reciprocates; but as he has made this inquiry, and I have answered it before, he has got it without my getting anything in return. He has got my answer on the Fugitive Slave law.\n\nNow, gentlemen, I don't want to read at any greater length, but this is the true complexion of all I have ever said in regard to the institution of slavery and the black race. This is the whole of it, and anything that argues me into his idea of perfect social and political equality with the negro, is but a specious and fantastic arrangement of words, by which a man can prove a horse-chestnut to be a chestnut horse. [Laughter.] I will say here, while upon this subject, that I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so. I have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and the black races. There is a physical difference between the two, which, in my judgment, will probably forever forbid their living together upon the footing of perfect equality, and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity that there must be a difference, I, as well as Judge Douglas, am in favor of the race to which I belong having the superior position. I have never said anything to the contrary, but I hold that, notwithstanding all this, there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence, the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. [Loud cheers.] I hold that he is as much entitled to these as the white man. I agree with Judge Douglas he is not my equal in many respects-certainly not in color, perhaps not in moral or intellectual endowment. But in the right to eat the bread, without the leave of anybody else, which his own hand earns, _he is my equal and the equal of Judge Douglas, and the equal of every living man._ [Great applause.]\n\nNow I pass on to consider one or two more of these little follies. The Judge is wofully at fault about his early friend Lincoln being a \"grocery keeper.\" [Laughter.] I don't know as it would be a great sin, if I had been; but he is mistaken. Lincoln never kept a grocery anywhere in the world. [Laughter.] It is true that Lincoln did work the latter part of one winter in a little still house, up at the head of a hollow. [Roars of laughter.] And so I think my friend, the Judge, is equally at fault when he charges me at the time when I was in Congress of having opposed our soldiers who were fighting in the Mexican war. The Judge did not make his charge very distinctly, but I can tell you what he can prove, by referring to the record. You remember I was an old Whig, and whenever the Democratic party tried to get me to vote that the war had been righteously begun by the President, I would not do it. But whenever they asked for any money, or land-warrants, or anything to pay the soldiers there, during all that time, I gave the same vote that Judge Douglas did. [Loud applause.] You can think as you please as to whether that was consistent. Such is the truth; and the Judge has the right to make all he can out of it. But when he, by a general charge, conveys the idea that I withheld supplies from the soldiers who were fighting in the Mexican war, or did anything else to hinder the soldiers, he is, to say the least, grossly and altogether mistaken, as a consultation of the records will prove to him.\n\nAs I have not used up so much of my time as I had supposed, I will dwell a little longer upon one or two of these minor topics upon which the Judge has spoken. He has read from my speech in Springfield, in which I say that \"a house divided against itself cannot stand.\" Does the Judge say it _can_ stand? [Laughter.] I don't know whether he does or not. The Judge does not seem to be attending to me just now, but I would like to know if it is his opinion that a house divided against itself _can stand_. If he does, then there is a question of veracity, not between him and me, but between the Judge and an authority of a somewhat higher character. [Laughter and applause.]\n\nNow, my friends, I ask your attention to this matter for the purpose of saying something seriously. I know that the Judge may readily enough agree with me that the maxim which was put forth by the Saviour is true, but he may allege that I misapply it; and the Judge has a right to urge that, in my application, I do misapply it, and then I have a right to show that I do _not_ misapply it. When he undertakes to say that because I think this nation, so far as the question of slavery is concerned, will all become one thing or all the other, I am in favor of bringing about a dead uniformity in the various States, in all their institutions, he argues erroneously. The great variety of the local institutions in the States, springing from differences in the soil, differences in the face of the country, and in the climate, are bonds of Union. They do not make \"a house divided against itself,\" but they make a house united. If they produce in one section of the country what is called for by the wants of another section, and this other section can supply the wants of the first, they are not matters of discord but bonds of union, true bonds of union. But can this question of slavery be considered as among _these_ varieties in the institutions of the country? I leave it to you to say whether, in the history of our Government, this institution of slavery has not always failed to be a bond of union, and, on the contrary, been an apple of discord, and an element of division in the house. [Cries of \"Yes, yes,\" and applause.] I ask you to consider whether, so long as the moral constitution of men's minds shall continue to be the same, after this generation and assemblage shall sink into the grave, and another race shall arise, with the same moral and intellectual development we have-whether, if that institution is standing in the same irritating position in which it now is, it will not continue an element of division? [Cries of \"Yes, yes.\"] If so, then I have a right to say that, in regard to this question, the Union is a house divided against itself; and when the Judge reminds me that I have often said to him that the institution of slavery has existed for eighty years in some States, and yet it does not exist in some others, I agree to the fact, and I account for it by looking at the position in which our fathers originally placed it-restricting it from the new Territories where it had not gone, and legislating to cut off its source by the abrogation of the slave-trade thus putting the seal of legislation _against its spread_. The public mind _did_ rest in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction. [Cries of \"Yes, yes,\"] But lately, I think-and in this I charge nothing on the Judge's motives-lately, I think, that he, and those acting with him, have placed that institution on a new basis, which looks to the _perpetuity and nationalization of slavery_. [Loud cheers.] And while it is placed upon this new basis, I say, and I have said, that I believe we shall not have peace upon the question until the opponents of slavery arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction; or, on the other hand, that its advocates will push it forward until it shall become alike lawful in all the States, old as well as new, North as well as South. Now, I believe if we could arrest the spread, and place it where Washington, and Jefferson, and Madison placed it, it _would be_ in the course of ultimate extinction, and the public mind _would_, as for eighty years past, believe that it was in the course of ultimate extinction. The crisis would be past and the institution might be let alone for a hundred years, if it should live so long, in the States where it exists, yet it would be going out of existence in the way best for both the black and the white races. [Great cheering.]\n\nA VOICE- \"Then do you repudiate Popular Sovereignty?\"\n\nMR. LINCOLN-Well, then, let us talk about Popular Sovereignty! [Laughter.] What is Popular Sovereignty? [Cries of \"A humbug,\" \"a humbug.\"] Is it the right of the people to have Slavery or not have it, as they see fit, in the territories? I will state-and I have an able man to watch me-my understanding is that Popular Sovereignty, as now applied to the question of slavery, does allow the people of a Territory to have slavery if they want to, but does not allow them _not_ to have it if they _do not_ want it. [Applause and laughter.] I do not mean that if this vast concourse of people were in a Territory of the United States, any one of them would be obliged to have a slave if he did not want one; but I do say that, as I understand the Dred Scott decision, if any one man wants slaves, all the rest have no way of keeping that one man from holding them.\n\nWhen I made my speech at Springfield, of which the Judge complains, and from which he quotes, I really was not thinking of the things which he ascribes to me at all. I had no thought in the world that I was doing anything to bring about a war between the free and slave States. I had no thought in the world that I was doing anything to bring about a political and social equality of the black and white races. It never occurred to me that I was doing anything or favoring anything to reduce to a dead uniformity all the local institutions of the various States. But I must say, in all fairness to him, if he thinks I am doing something which leads to these bad results, it is none the better that I did not mean it. It is just as fatal to the country, if I have any influence in producing it, whether I intend it or not. But can it be true, that placing this institution upon the original basis-the basis upon which our fathers placed it-can have any tendency to set the Northern and the Southern States at war with one another, or that it can have any tendency to make the people of Vermont raise sugarcane, because they raise it in Louisiana, or that it can compel the people of Illinois to cut pine logs on the Grand Prairie, where they will not grow, because they cut pine logs in Maine, where they do grow? [Laughter.] The Judge says this is a new principle started in regard to this question. Does the Judge claim that he is working on the plan of the founders of Government? I think he says in some of his speeches-indeed, I have one here now-that he saw evidence of a policy to allow slavery to be south of a certain line, while north of it it should be excluded, and he saw an indisposition on the part of the country to stand upon that policy, and therefore he set about studying the subject upon _original principles_, and upon _original principles_ he got up the Nebraska bill! I am fighting it upon these _\"_ original principles''-fighting it in the Jeffersonian, Washingtonian, and Madisonian fashion. [Laughter and applause.]\n\nNow, my friends, I wish you to attend for a little while to one or two other things in that Springfield speech. My main object was to show, so far as my humble ability was capable of showing to the people of this country, what I believed was the truth-that there was a _tendency_, if not a conspiracy among those who have engineered this slavery question for the last four or five years, to make slavery perpetual and universal in this nation. Having made that speech principally for that object, after arranging the evidences that I thought tended to prove my proposition, I concluded with this bit of comment:\n\n\"We cannot absolutely know that these exact adaptations are the result of preconcert, but when we see a lot of framed timbers, different portions of which we know have been gotten out at different times and places, and by different workmen-Stephen, Franklin, Roger and James, for instance-and when we see these timbers joined together, and see they exactly make the frame of a house or a mill, all the tenons and mortices exactly fitting, and all the lengths and proportions of the different pieces exactly adapted to their respective places, and not a piece too many or too few -not omitting even the scaffolding-or if a single piece be lacking, we see the place in the frame exactly fitted and prepared yet to bring such piece in-in such a case we feel it impossible not to believe that Stephen and Franklin, and Roger and James, all understood one another from the beginning, and all worked upon a common plan or draft drawn before the first blow was struck.\" [Great cheers.]\n\nWhen my friend, Judge Douglas, came to Chicago, on the 9th of July, this speech having been delivered on the 16th of June, he made an harangue there, in which he took hold of this speech of mine, showing that he had carefully read it; and while he paid no attention to _this_ matter at all, but complimented me as being a \"kind, amiable and intelligent gentleman,\" notwithstanding I had said this, he goes on and eliminates, or draws out, from my speech this tendency of mine to set the States at war with one another, to make all the institutions uniform, and set the niggers and white people to marrying together. [Laughter.] Then, as the Judge had complimented me with these pleasant titles (I must confess to my weakness), I was a little \"taken,\" [laughter] for it came from a great man. I was not very much accustomed to flattery, and it came the sweeter to me. I was rather like the Hoosier, with the gingerbread, when he said he reckoned he loved it better than any other man, and got less of it. [Roars of laughter.] As the Judge had so flattered me, I could not make up my mind that he meant to deal unfairly with me; so I went to work to show him that he misunderstood the whole scope of my speech, and that I really never intended to set the people at war with one another. As an illustration, the next time I met him, which was at Springfield, I used this expression, that I claimed no right under the Constitution, nor had I any inclination, to enter into the Slave States and interfere with the institutions of slavery. He says upon that: Lincoln will not enter into the Slave States, but will go to the banks of the Ohio, on this side, and shoot over! [Laughter.] He runs on, step by step, in the horse-chestnut style of argument, until in the Springfield speech he says, \"Unless he shall be successful in firing his batteries, until he shall have extinguished slavery in all the States, the Union shall be dissolved.\" Now I don't think that was exactly the way to treat \"a kind, amiable, intelligent gentleman.\" I know if I had asked the Judge to show when or where it was I had said that, if I didn't succeed in firing into the slave States until slavery should be extinguished, the Union should be dissolved, he could not have shown it. I understand what he would do. He would say, \"I don't mean to quote from you, but this was the _result_ of what you say.\" But I have the right to ask, and I do ask now, Did you not put it in such a form that an ordinary reader or listener would take it as an expression _from me?_[Laughter.]\n\nIn a speech at Springfield, on the night of the 17th, I thought I might as well attend to my own business a little, and I recalled his attention as well as I could to this charge of conspiracy to nationalize slavery. I called his attention to the fact that he had acknowledged, in my hearing twice, that he had carefully read the speech, and, in the language of the lawyers, as he had twice read the speech, and still had put in no plea or answer, I took a default on him. I insisted that I had a right then to renew that charge of conspiracy. Ten days afterward I met the Judge at Clinton-that is to say, I was on the ground, but not in the discussion-and heard him make a speech. Then he comes in with his plea to this charge, for the first time, and his plea when put in, as well as I can recollect it, amounted to this: that he never had any talk with Judge Taney or the President of the United States with regard to the Dred Scott decision before it was made. I (Lincoln) ought to know that the man who makes a charge without knowing it to be true, falsifies as much as he who knowingly tells a falsehood; and lastly, that he would pronounce the whole thing a falsehood; but he would make no personal application of the charge of falsehood, not because of any regard for the \"kind, amiable, intelligent gentleman,\" but because of his own personal self-respect! [Roars of Laughter.] I have understood since then (but [turning to Judge Douglas] will not hold the Judge to it if he is not willing) that he has broken through the \"self-respect,\" and has got to saying the thing _out_. The Judge nods to me that it is so. [Laughter.] It is fortunate for me that I can keep as good-humored as I do, when the Judge acknowledges that he has been trying to make a question of veracity with me. I know the Judge is a great man, while I am only a small man, but _I feel that I have got him_. [Tremendous cheering.] I demur to that plea. I waive all objections that it was not filed till after default was taken, and demur to it upon the merits. What if Judge Douglas never did talk with Chief Justice Taney and the President, before the Dred Scott decision was made, does it follow that he could not have had as perfect an understanding without talking as with it? I am not disposed to stand upon my legal advantage. I am disposed to take his denial as being like an answer in chancery, that he neither had any knowledge, information or belief in the existence of such a conspiracy. I am disposed to take his answer as being as broad as though he had put it in these words. And now, I ask, even if he had done so, have not I a right to _prove it on him_, and to offer the evidence of more than two witnesses, by whom to prove it; and if the evidence proves the existence of the conspiracy, does his broad answer denying all knowledge, information, or belief, disturb the fact? It can only show that he was _used_ by conspirators, and was not a _leader_ of them. [Vociferous cheering.]\n\nNow, in regard to his reminding me of the moral rule that persons who tell what they do not know to be true, falsify as much as those who knowingly tell falsehoods. I remember the rule, and it must be borne in mind that in what I have read to you, I do not say that I _know_ such a conspiracy to exist. To that I reply, _I believe it_. If the Judge says that I do _not_ believe it, then _he_ says what _he_ does not know, and falls within his own rule, that he who asserts a thing which he does not know to be true, falsifies as much as he who knowingly tells a falsehood. I want to call your attention to a little discussion on that branch of the case, and the evidence which brought my mind to the conclusion which I expressed as my _belief_. If, in arraying that evidence, I had stated anything which was false or erroneous, it needed but that Judge Douglas should point it out, and I would have taken it back with all the kindness in the world. I do not deal in that way. If I have brought forward anything not a fact, if he will point it out, it will not even ruffle me to take it back. But if he will not point out anything erroneous in the evidence, is it not rather for him to show, by a comparison of the evidence, that I have _reasoned_ falsely, than to call the \"kind, amiable, intelligent gentleman\" a liar? [Cheers and laughter.] If I have reasoned to a false conclusion, it is the vocation of an able debater to show by argument that I have wandered to an erroneous conclusion. I want to ask your attention to a portion of the Nebraska bill, which Judge Douglas has quoted: \"It being the true intent and meaning of this act, not to legislate slavery into any Territory or State, nor to exclude it therefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the Constitution of the United States.\" Thereupon Judge Douglas and others began to argue in favor of \"Popular Sovereignty\" -the right of the people to have slaves if they wanted them, and to exclude slavery if they did not want them. \"But,\" said, in substance, a Senator from Ohio (Mr. Chase, I believe), \"we more than suspect that you do not mean to allow the people to exclude slavery if they wish to, and if you do mean it, accept an amendment which I propose expressly authorizing the people to exclude slavery.\" I believe I have the amendment here before me, which was offered, and under which the people of the Territory, through their proper representatives, might, if they saw fit, prohibit the existence of slavery therein. And now I state it as a _fact,_ to be taken back if there is any mistake about it, that Judge Douglas and those acting with him _voted that amendment down_. [Tremendous applause.] I now think that those men who voted it down, had a _real reason_ for doing so. They know what that reason was. It looks to us, since we have seen the Dred Scott decision pronounced, holding that, \"under the Constitution,\" the people cannot exclude slavery-I say it looks to outsiders, poor, simple, \"amiable, intelligent gentlemen,\" as though the niche was left as a place to put that Dred Scott decision in - [laughter and cheers] - a niche which would have been spoiled by adopting the amendment. And now, I say again, if _this_ was not the reason, it will avail the Judge much more to calmly and good-humoredly point out to these people what that _other_ reason was for voting the amendment down, than, swelling himself up, to vociferate that he may be provoked to call somebody a liar. [Tremendous applause.]\n\nAgain: there is in that same quotation from the Nebraska bill this clause- \"It being the true intent and meaning of this bill not to legislate slavery into any Territory or _State_.\" I have always been puzzled to know what business the word \"State\" had in that connection, Judge Douglas knows. _He put it there_. He knows what he put it there for. We outsiders cannot say what he put it there for. The law they were passing was not about States, and was not making provisions for States. What was it placed there for? After seeing the Dred Scott decision, which holds that the people cannot exclude slavery from a _Territory_, if another Dred Scott decision shall come, holding that they cannot exclude it from a _State_, we shall discover that when the word was originally put there, it was in view of something which was to come in due time, we shall see that it was the _other half_ of something. [Applause.] I now say again, if there is any different reason for putting it there, Judge Douglas, in a good humored way, without calling anybody a liar, _can tell what the reason was_. [Renewed cheers.]\n\nWhen the Judge spoke at Clinton, he came very near making a charge of falsehood against me. He used, as I found it printed in a newspaper, which, I remember, was very nearly like the real speech, the following language:\n\n\"I did not answer the charge [of conspiracy] before, for the reason that I did not suppose there was a man in America with a heart so corrupt as to believe such a charge could be true. I have too much respect for Mr. Lincoln to suppose he is serious in making the charge.\"\n\nI confess this is rather a curious view, that out of respect for me he should consider I was making what I deemed rather a grave charge in fun. [Laughter.] I confess it strikes me rather strangely. But I let it pass. As the Judge did not for a moment believe that there was a man in America whose heart was so \"corrupt\" as to make such a charge, and as he places me among the \"men in America\" who have hearts base enough to make such a charge, I hope he will excuse me if I hunt out another charge very like this; and if it should turn out that in hunting I should find that other, and it should turn out to be Judge Douglas himself who made it, I hope he will reconsider this question of the deep corruption of heart he has thought fit to ascribe to me. [Great applause and laughter.] In Judge Douglas's speech of March 22d, 1858, which I hold in my hand, he says:\n\n\"In this connection there is another topic to which I desire to allude. I seldom refer to the course of newspapers, or notice the articles which they publish in regard to myself; but the course of the Washington _Union_ has been so extraordinary, for the last two or three months, that I think it well enough to make some allusion to it. It has read me out of the Democratic party every other day, at least for two or three months, and keeps reading me out, (laughter;) and, as if it had not succeeded, still continues to read me out, using such terms as \"traitor,\" \"renegade,\" \"deserter,\" and other kind and polite epithets of that nature. Sir, I have no vindication to make of my Democracy against the Washington _Union_, or any other newspapers. I am willing to allow my history and action for the last twenty years to speak for themselves as to my political principles, and my fidelity to political obligations. The Washington _Union_ has a personal grievance. When its editor was nominated for public printer I declined to vote for him, and stated that at some time I might give my reasons for doing so. Since I declined to give that vote, this scurrilous abuse, these vindictive and constant attacks have been repeated almost daily on me. Will my friend from Michigan read the article to which I allude?\"\n\nThis is a part of the speech. You must excuse me from reading the entire article of the Washington _Union_, as Mr. Stuart read it for Mr. Douglas. The Judge goes on and sums up, as I think, correctly:\n\n\"Mr. President, you here find several distinct propositions advanced boldly by the Washington Union editorially, and apparently _authoritatively_, and any man who questions any of them is denounced as an Abolitionist, a Freesoiler, a fanatic. The propositions are, first, that the primary object of all government at its original institution is the protection of person and property; second, that the Constitution of the United States declares that the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States; and that, therefore, thirdly, all State laws, whether organic or otherwise, which prohibit the citizens of one State from settling in another with their slave property, and especially declaring it forfeited, are direct violations of the original intention of the Government and Constitution of the United States; and, fourth, that the emancipation of the slaves of the Northern States was a gross outrage on the rights of property, inasmuch as it was involuntarily done on the part of the owner.\n\n\"Remember that this article was published in the _Union_ on the 17th of November, and on the 18th appeared the first article giving the adhesion of the _Union_ to the Lecompton Constitution. It was in these words:\n\n\"KANSAS AND HER CONSTITUTION-The vexed question is settled. The problem is solved. The dead point of danger is passed. All serious trouble to Kansas affairs is over and gone'-\n\n\"And a column, nearly, of the same sort. Then, when you come to look into the Lecompton Constitution, you find the same doctrine incorporated in it which was put forth editorially in the _Union_. What is it?\n\n\" `ARTICLE 7, _Section 1_. The right of property is before and higher than any Constitutional sanction; and the right of the owner of a slave to such slave and its increase is the same and as inviolable as the right of the owner of any property whatever.'\n\n\"Then in the schedule is a provision that the Constitution may be amended after 1864 by a two-thirds vote.\n\n\"`But no alteration shall be made to affect the right of property in the ownership of slaves.'\n\n\"It will be seen by these clauses in the Lecompton Constitution, that they are identical in spirit with the _authoritative_ article in the Washington _Union_ of the day previous to its indorsement of this Constitution.\"\n\nI pass over some portions of the speech, and I hope that any one who feels interested in this matter will read the entire section of the speech, and see whether I do the Judge injustice. He proceeds: \"When I saw that article in the _Union_ of the 17th of November, followed by the glorification of the Lecompton Constitution on the 18th of November, and this clause in the Constitution asserting the doctrine that a State has no right to prohibit slavery within its limits, I saw that there was a _fatal blow_ being struck at the sovereignty of the States of this Union.\"\n\nI stop the quotation there, again requesting that it may all be read. I have read all of the portion I desire to comment upon. What is this charge that the Judge thinks I must have a very corrupt heart to make? It was a purpose on the part of certain high functionaries to make it impossible for the people of one State to prohibit the people of any other State from entering it with their \"property,\" so called, and making it a slave State. In other words, it was a charge implying a design to make the institution of slavery national. And now I ask your attention to what Judge Douglas has himself done here. I know he made that part of the speech as a reason why he had refused to vote for a certain man for public printer, but when we get at it, the charge itself is the very one I made against him, that he thinks I am so corrupt for uttering. Now, whom does he make that charge against? Does he make it against that newspaper editor merely? No; he says it is identical in spirit with the Lecompton Constitution, and so the framers of that Constitution are brought in with the editor of the newspaper in that \"fatal blow being struck.\" He did not call it a \"conspiracy.\" In his language it is a \"fatal blow being struck.\" And if the words carry the meaning better when changed from a \"conspiracy\" into a \"fatal blow being struck,\" I will change _my_ expression and call it \"fatal blow being struck.\" We see the charge made not merely against the editor of the _Union_, but all the framers of the Lecompton Constitution; and not only so, but the article was an _authoritative_ article. By whose authority? Is there any question but he means it was by the authority of the President and his Cabinet-the Administration?\n\nIs there any sort of question but he means to make that charge? Then there are the editors of the _Union_, the framers of the Lecompton Constitution, the President of the United States and his Cabinet, and all the supporters of the Lecompton Constitution, in Congress and out of Congress, who are all involved in this \"fatal blow being struck.\" I commend to Judge Douglas's consideration the question of _how corrupt a man's heart must be to make such a charge!_ [Vociferous cheering.]\n\nNow, my friends, I have but one branch of the subject, in the little time I have left, to which to call your attention, and as I shall come to a close at the end of that branch, it is probable that I shall not occupy quite all the time allotted to me. Although on these questions I would like to talk twice as long as I have, I could not enter upon another head and discuss it properly without running over my time. I ask the attention of the people here assembled and elsewhere, to the course that Judge Douglas is pursuing every day as bearing upon this question of making slavery national. Not going back to the records, but taking the speeches he makes, the speeches he made yesterday and day before, and makes constantly all over the country-I ask your attention to them. In the first place, what is necessary to make the institution national? Not war. There is no danger that the people of Kentucky will shoulder their muskets, and, with a young nigger stuck on every bayonet, march into Illinois and force them upon us. There is no danger of our going over there and making war upon them. Then what is necessary for the nationalization of slavery? It is simply the next Dred Scott decision. It is merely for the Supreme Court to decide that no _State_ under the Constitution can exclude it, just as they have already decided that under the Constitution neither Congress nor the Territorial Legislature can do it. When that is decided and acquiesced in, the whole thing is done. This being true, and this being the way, as I think, that slavery is to be made national, let us consider what Judge Douglas is doing every day to that end. In the first place, let us see what influence he is exerting on public sentiment. In this and like communities, public sentiment is everything. With public sentiment, nothing can fail; without it nothing can succeed. Consequently he who moulds public sentiment, goes deeper than he who enacts statutes or pronounces decisions. He makes statutes and decisions possible or impossible to be executed. This must be borne in mind, as also the additional fact that Judge Douglas is a man of vast influence, so great that it is enough for many men to profess to believe anything, when they once find out that Judge Douglas professes to believe it. Consider also the attitude he occupies at the head of a large party-a party which he claims has a majority of all the voters in the country. This man sticks to a decision which forbids the people of a Territory from excluding slavery, and he does so not because he says it is right in itself-he does not give any opinion on that-but because it has been _decided by the court_, and being decided by court, he is, and you are bound to take it in your political action as _law_-not that he judges at all of its merits, but because a decision of the court is to him a \"_Thus saith the Lord_.\" [Applause.] He places it on that ground alone, and you will bear in mind that, thus committing himself unreservedly to this decision, _commits him to the next one_ just as firmly as to this. He did not commit himself on account of the merit or demerit of the decision, but it is a _Thus saith the Lord_. The next decision, as much as this, will be a _Thus saith the Lord_. There is nothing that can divert or turn him away from this decision. It is nothing that I point out to him that his great prototype, Gen. Jackson, did not believe in the binding force of decisions. It is nothing to him that Jefferson did not so believe. I have said that I have often heard him approve of Jackson's course in disregarding the decision of the Supreme Court pronouncing a National Bank constitutional. He says, I did not hear him say so. He denies the accuracy of my recollection. I say he ought to know better than I, but I will make no question about this thing, though it still seems to me that I heard him say it twenty times. [Applause and laughter.] I will tell him though, that he now claims to stand on the Cincinnati platform, which affirms that Congress _cannot_ charter a National Bank, in the teeth of that old standing decision that Congress _can_ charter a bank. [Loud applause.] And I remind him of another piece of history on the question of respect for judicial decisions, and it is a piece of Illinois history, belonging to a time when the large party to which Judge Douglas belonged, were displeased with a decision of the Supreme Court of Illinois, because they had decided that a Governor could not remove a Secretary of State. You will find the whole story in Ford's History of Illinois, and I know that Judge Douglas will not deny that he was then in favor of overslaughing that decision by the mode of adding five new Judges, so as to vote down the four old ones. Not only so, but it ended in _the Judge's sitting down on that very bench as one of the five new Judges to break down the four old ones_. [Cheers and laughter.] It was in this way precisely that he got his title of Judge. Now, when the Judge tells me that men appointed conditionally to sit as members of a court, will have to be catechised beforehand upon some subject, I say, \"You know, Judge; you have tried it.\" [Laughter.] When he says a court of this kind will lose the confidence of all men, will be prostituted and disgraced by such a proceeding, I say, \"You know best, Judge; you have been through the mill.\" But I cannot shake Judge Douglas's teeth loose from the Dred Scott decision. Like some obstinate animal (I mean no disrespect), that will hang on when he has once got his teeth fixed; you may cut off a leg, or you may tear away an arm, still he will not relax his hold. And so I may point out to the Judge, and say that he is bespattered all over, from the beginning of his political life to the present time, with attacks upon judicial decisions-I may cut off limb after limb of his public record, and strive to wrench him from a single dictum of the court-yet I cannot divert him from it. He hangs, to the last, to the Dred Scott decision. [Loud cheers.] These things show there is a purpose _strong as death and eternity_ for which he adheres to this decision, and for which he will adhere to _all other decisions_ of the same court. [Vociferous applause.]\n\nA HIBERNIAN- \"Give us something besides Dred Scott.\"\n\nMR. LINCOLN-Yes; no doubt you want to hear something that don't hurt. [Laughter and applause.] Now, having spoken of the Dred Scott decision, one more word and I am done. Henry Clay, my beau ideal of a statesman, the man for whom I fought all my humble life-Henry Clay once said of a class of men who would repress all tendencies to liberty and ultimate emancipation, that they must, if they would do this, go back to the era of our Independence, and muzzle the cannon which thunders its annual joyous return; they must blow out the moral lights around us; they must penetrate the human soul, and eradicate there the love of liberty; and then, and not till then, could they perpetuate slavery in this country! [Loud cheers.] To my thinking, Judge Douglas is, by his example and vast influence, doing that very thing in this community, [cheers,] when he says that the negro has nothing in the Declaration of Independence. Henry Clay plainly understood the contrary. Judge Douglas is going back to the era of our Revolution, and to the extent of his ability, muzzling the cannon which thunders its annual joyous return. When he invites any people, willing to have slavery, to establish it, he is blowing out the moral lights around us. [Cheers.] When he says he \"cares not whether slavery is voted down or voted up''-that it is a sacred right of self-government-he is, in my judgment, penetrating the human soul and eradicating the light of reason and the love of liberty in this American people. [Enthusiastic and continued applause.] And now I will only say that when, by all these means and appliances, Judge Douglas shall succeed in bringing public sentiment to an exact accordance with his own views-when these vast assemblages shall echo back all these sentiments-when they shall come to repeat his views and to avow his principles, and to say all that he says on these mighty questions-then it needs only the formality of the second Dred Scott decision, which he indorses in advance, to make slavery alike lawful in all the States-old as well as new, North as well as South.\n\nMy friends, that ends the chapter. The Judge can take his half hour.\n\n**Mr. Douglas' Reply**\n\nFellow citizens: I will now occupy the half hour allotted to me in replying to Mr. Lincoln. The first point to which I will call your attention is, as to what I said about the organization of the Republican party in 1854, and the platform that was formed on the 5th of October, of that year, and I will then put the question to Mr. Lincoln, whether or not, he approves of each article in that platform (\"he answered that already\"), and ask for a specific answer. (\"He has answered.\" \"You cannot make him answer,\" &c.) I did not charge him with being a member of the committee which reported that platform. (\"Yes, you did.\") I charged that that platform was the platform of the Republican party adopted by them. The fact that it was the platform of the Republican party is not denied, but Mr. Lincoln now says, that although his name was on the committee which reported it, that he does not think he was there, but thinks he was in Tazewell, holding court. (\"He said he was there.\") Gentlemen, I ask your silence, and no interruption. Now, I want to remind Mr. Lincoln that he was at Springfield when that Convention was held and those resolutions adopted. (\"You can't do it.\" \"He wasn't there,\" &c.)\n\n[MR. GLOVER, chairman of the Republican committee - I hope no Republican will interrupt Mr. Douglas. The masses listened to Mr. Lincoln attentively, and as respectable men we ought now to hear Mr. Douglas, and without interruption.] (\"Good.\")\n\nMR. DOUGLAS, resuming - The point I am going to remind Mr. Lincoln of is this: that after I had made my speech in 1854, during the fair, he gave me notice that he was going to reply to me the next day. I was sick at the time, but I staid over in Springfield to hear his reply and to reply to him. On that day this very Convention, the resolutions adopted by which I have read, was to meet in the Senate chamber. He spoke in the hall of the House; and when he got through his speech-my recollection is distinct, and I shall never forget it-Mr. Codding walked in as I took the stand to reply, and gave notice that the Republican State Convention would meet instantly in the Senate chamber, and called upon the Republicans to retire there and go into this very Convention, instead of remaining and listening to me. (Three cheers for Douglas.)\n\nMR. LINCOLN, interrupting, excitedly and angrily - Judge, add that I went along with them. (This interruption was made in a pitifulm, mean, sneaking way, as Lincoln floundered around the stand.)\n\nMR. DOUGLAS-Gentlemen, Mr. Lincoln tells me to add that he went along with them to the Senate chamber. I will not add that, because I do not know whether he did or not.\n\nMR. LINCOLN, again interrupting - I know he did not.\n\n[Two of the Republican committee here seized Mr. Lincoln and by a sudden jerk caused him to disappear from the front of the stand, one of them saying quite audibly, \"What are you making such a fuss for. Douglas didn't interrupt you, and can't you see that the people don't like it.\"]\n\nMR. DOUGLAS-I do not know whether he knows it or not, that is not the point, and I will yet bring him on to the question.\n\nIn the first place - Mr. Lincoln was selected by the very men who made the Republican organization, on that day, to reply to me. He spoke for them and for that party, and he was the leader of the party; and on the very day he made his speech in reply to me, preaching up this same doctrine of negro equality, under the Declaration of Independence, this Republican party met in Convention. (Three cheers for Douglas.) Another evidence that he was acting in concert with them is to be found in the fact that that Convention waited an hour after its time of meeting to hear Lincoln's speech, and Codding one of their leading men, marched in the moment Lincoln got through, and gave notice that they did not want to hear me, and would proceed with the business of the Convention. Still another fact. I have here a newspaper printed at Springfield, Mr. Lincoln's own town, in October, 1854, a few days afterward, publishing these resolutions, charging Mr. Lincoln with entertaining these sentiments, and trying to prove that they were also the sentiments of Mr. Yates, then candidate for Congress. This has been published on Mr. Lincoln over and over again, and never before has he denied it. (Three cheers.)\n\nBut, my friends, this denial of his that he did not act on the committee, is a miserable quibble to avoid the main issue, (applause.) (\"That's so,\") which is, that this Republican platform declares in favor of the unconditional repeal of the Fugitive Slave law. Has Lincoln answered whether he indorsed that or not? (No, no.) I called his attention to it when I first addressed you, and asked him for an answer, and I then predicted that he would not answer. (Bravo, glourious, and cheers.) How does he answer. Why, that he was not on the committee that wrote the resolutions. (Laughter.) I then repeated the next proposition contained in the resolutions, which was to restrict slavery in those States in which it exists, and asked him whether he indorsed it. Does he answer yes, or no? He says in reply, \"I was not on the committee at the time; I was up in Tazewell.\" The next question I put to him was, whether he was in favor of prohibiting the admission of any more slave States into the Union. I put the question to him distinctly, whether, if the people of the Territory, when they had sufficient population to make a State, should form their Constitution recognizing slavery, he would vote for or against its admission. (\"That's it.\") He is a candidate for the United States Senate, and it is possible, if he should be elected, that he would have to vote directly on that question. (\"He never will.\") I asked him to answer me and you, whether he would vote to admit a State into the Union, with slavery or without it, as its own people might choose. (\"Hear him,\" \"That's the docntrine,\" and applause.) He did not answer that question. (\"He never will.\") He dodges that question also, under the cover that he was not on the Committee at the time, that he was not present when the platform was made. I want to know if he should happen to be in the Senate when a State applied for admission, with a Constitution acceptable to her own people, he would vote to admit that State, if slavery was one of its institutions. (That's the question.) He avoids the answer.\n\nMR. LINCOLN-interrupting a third time excitedly, No, Judge - (Mr. Lincoln again disappeared suddenly aided by a pull from behind.)\n\nMR. DOUGLAS. It is true he gives the Abolitionists to understand by a hint that he would not vote to admit such a State. And why? He goes on to say that the man who would talk about giving each State the right to have slavery, or not, as it pleased, was akin to the man who would muzzle the guns which thundered forth the annual joyous return of the day of our independence. (Great laughter.) He says that that kind of talk is casting a blight on the glory of this country. What is the meaning of that? That he is not in favor of each State to have the right of doing as it pleases on the slavery question? (\"Stick it to him,\" \"don't spare him,\" and applause.) I will put the question to him again and again, and I intend to force it out of him. (Immense applause.)\n\nThen again, this platform which was made at Springfield by his own party, when he was its acknowledged head, provides that Republicans will insist on the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia, and I asked Lincoln specifically whether he agreed with them in that? Did you get an answer? (\"No, no.\") He is afraid to answer it. (\"We will not vote for him.\") He knows I will trot him down to Egypt. (Laughter and cheers.) I intend to make him answer there, (\"that's right,\") or I will show the people of Illinois that he does not intend to answer these questions. (\"Keep him to the point,\" \"give us more,\" etc.) The convention to which I have been alluding goes a little further, and pledges itself to exclude slavery from all the Territories over which the General Government has exclusive jurisdiction north of 36 deg. 30 min., as well as South. Now I want to know whether he approves that provision. (He'll never answer and cheers.) I want him to answer, and when he does, I want to know his opinion on another point, which is, whether he will redeem the pledge of this platform and resist the acquirement of any more territory unless slavery therein shall be forever prohibited. I want him to answer this last question. Each of the questions I have put to him are practical questions-questions based upon the fundamental principles of the Black Republican party, and I want to know whether he is the first, last, and only choice of a party with whom he does not agree in principle. (\"Great applause,\") (\"Rake him down.\") He does not deny but that that principle was unanimously adopted by the Republican party; he does not deny that the whole Republican party is pledged to it; he does not deny that a man who is not faithful to it is faithless to the Republican party; and now I want to know whether that party is unanimously in favor of a man who does not adopt that creed and agree with them in their principles: I want to know whether the man who does not agree with them, and who is afraid to avow his differences, and who dodges the issue, is the first, last, and only choice of the Republican party. (Cheers.) A VOICE, how about this conspiracy?\n\nMR. DOUGLAS, never mind, I will come to that soon enough. (Bravo, Judge, hurra, three cheers for Douglas.) But the platform which I have read to you not only lays down these principles, but it adds:\n\n_Resolved_, That in furtherance of these principles we will use such constitutional and lawful means as shall seem best adapted to their accomplishment, and that we will support no man for office, under the general or state government, who is not positively and fully committed to the support of these principles, and whose personal character and conduct is not a guaranty that he is reliable, and who shall not have abjured old party allegiance and ties.\n\n(\"Good,\" \"you have him,\" &c.)\n\nThe Black Republican party stands pledged that they will never support Lincoln until he has pledged himself to that platform, (tremendous applause, men throwing up their hats, and shouting, \"you've got him,\") but he cannot devise his answer; he has not made up his mind whether he will or not. (Great laughter.) He talked about everything else he could think of to occupy his hour and a half, and when he could not think of anything more to say, without an excuse for refusing to answer these questions, he sat down long before his time was out. (Cheers.)\n\nIn relation to Mr. Lincoln's charge of conspiracy against me, I have a word to say. In his speech today he quotes a playful part of his speech at Springfield, about Stephen, and James, and Franklin, and Roger, and says that I did not take exception to it. I did not answer it, and he repeats it again. I did not take exception to this figure of his. He has a right to be as playful as he pleases in throwing his arguments together, and I will not object; but I did take objection to his second Springfield speech, in which he stated that he intended his first speech as a charge of corruption or conspiracy against the Supreme Court of the United States, President Pierce, President Buchanan, and myself. That gave the offensive character to the charge. He then said that when he made it he did not know whether it was true or not (laughter), but inasmuch as Judge Douglas had not denied it, although he had replied to the other parts of his speech three times, he repeated it as a charge of conspiracy against me, thus charging me with moral turpitude. When he put it in that form I did say that inasmuch as he repeated the charge simply because I had not denied it, I would deprive him of the opportunity of ever repeating it again, by declaring that it was in all its bearings an infamous lie. (Three cheers for Douglas.) He says he will repeat it until I answer his folly and nonsense, about Stephen, and Franklin, and Roger, and Bob, and James.\n\nHe studied that out, prepared that one sentence with the greatest care, committed it to memory, and put it in his first Springfield speech, and now he carries that speech around and reads that sentence to show how pretty it is. (Laughter.) His vanity is wounded because I will not go into that beautiful figure of his about the building of a house. (Renewed laughter.) All I have to say is, that I am not green enough to let him make a charge which he acknowledges he does not know to be true, and then take up my time in answering it, when I know it to be false and nobody else knows it to be true. (Cheers.)\n\nI have not brought a charge of moral turpitude against him. When he, or any other man, brings one against me, instead of disproving it I will say that it is a lie, and let him prove it if he can. (Enthusiastic applause.)\n\nI have lived twenty-five years in Illinois. I have served you with all the fidelity and ability which I possess, (\"That's so,\" \"good.\" and cheers,) and Mr. Lincoln is at liberty to attack my public action, my votes, and my conduct; but when he dares to attack my moral integrity, by a charge of conspiracy between myself, Chief Justice Taney and the Supreme Court, and two Presidents of the United States, I will repel it. (\"Three cheers for Douglas.\")\n\nMr. Lincoln has not character enough for integrity and truth, merely on his own _ipse dixit_ to arraign President Buchanan, President Pierce, and nine judges of the Supreme Court, not one of whom would be complimented by being put on an equality with him. (\"Hit him again, three cheers\" &c.) There is an unpardonable presumption in a man putting himself up before thousands of people, and pretending that his _ipse dixit_, without proof, without fact and without truth, is enough to bring down and destroy the purest and best of living men. (\"Hear him,\" \"Three cheers.\")\n\nFellow-citizens, my time is fast expiring; I must pass on. Mr. Lincoln wants to know why I voted against Mr. Chase's amendment to the Nebraska bill. I will tell him. In the first place, the bill already conferred all the power which Congress had, by giving the people the whole power over the subject. Chase offered a proviso that they might abolish slavery, which by implication would convey the idea that they could prohibit by not introducing that institution. Gen. Cass asked him to modify his amendment, so as to provide that the people might either prohibit or introduce slavery, and thus make it fair and equal. Chase refused to so modify his proviso, and then Gen. Cass and all the rest of us, voted it down. (Immense cheering.) These facts appear on the journals and debates of Congress, where Mr. Lincoln found the charge, and if he had told the whole truth, there would have been no necessity for me to occupy your time in explaining the matter.\n\nMr. Lincoln wants to know why the word \"state,\" as well as \"territory,\" was put into the Nebraska Bill! I will tell him. It was put there to meet just such false arguments as he has been adducing. (Laughter.) That first, not only the people of the Territories should do as they pleased, but that when they come to be admitted as States, they should come into the Union with or without slavery, as the people determined. I meant to knock in the head this Abolition doctrine of Mr. Lincoln's, that there shall be no more slave States, even if the people want them. (Tremendous applause.) And it does not do for him to say, or for any other Black Republican to say, that there is nobody in favor of the doctrine of no more slave States, and that nobody wants to interfere with the right of the people to do as they please. What was the origin of the Missouri difficulty and the Missouri compromise? The people of Missouri formed a constitution as a slave State, and asked admission into the Union, but the Free Soil party of the North being in a majority, refused to admit her because she had slavery as one of her institutions. Hence this first slavery agitation arose upon a State and not upon a Territory, and yet Mr. Lincoln does not know why the word State was placed in the Kansas-Nebraska bill. (Great laughter and applause.) The whole Abolition agitation arose on that doctrine of prohibiting a State from coming in with Slavery or not, as it pleased, and that same doctrine is here in this Republican platform of 1854; it has never been repealed; and every Black Republican stands pledged by that platform, never to vote for any man who is not in favor of it. Yet Mr. Lincoln does not know that there is a man in the world who is in favor of preventing a State from coming in as it pleases, notwithstanding. The Springfield platform says that they, the Republican party, will not allow a State to come in under such circumstances. He is an ignorant man. (Cheers.)\n\nNow you see that upon these very points I am as far from bringing Mr. Lincoln up to the line as I ever was before. He does not want to avow his principles. I do want to avow mine, as clear as sunlight in mid-day. (Cheers and applause.) Democracy is founded upon the eternal principle of right. (That is the talk.) The plainer these principles are avowed before the people, the stronger will be the support which they will receive. I only wish I had the power to make them so clear that they would shine in the heavens for every man, woman, and child to read. (Loud cheering.) The first of those principles that I would proclaim would be in opposition to Mr. Lincoln's doctrine of uniformity between the different States, and I would declare instead the sovereign right of each State to decide the slavery question as well as all other domestic questions for themselves, without interference from any other State or power whatsoever. (Hurrah for Douglas.)\n\nWhen that principle is recognized, you will have peace and harmony and fraternal feeling between all the States of this Union; until you do recognize that doctrine, there will be sectional warfare agitating and distracting the country. What does Mr. Lincoln propose? He says that the Union cannot exist divided into free and slave States. If it cannot endure thus divided, then he must strive to make them all free or all slave, which will inevitably bring about a dissolution of the Union. (Cries of \"he can't do it.\")\n\nGentlemen, I am told that my time is out, and I am obliged to stop. (Three times three cheers were here given for Senator Douglas.)"

        "full_text_segment": "MY FELLOW-CITIZENS: When a man hears himself somewhat misrepresented, it provokes him-at least, I find it so with myself; but when misrepresentation becomes very gross and palpable, it is more apt to amuse him. The first thing I see fit to notice, is the fact that Judge Douglas alleges, after running through the history of the old Democratic and the old Whig parties, that Judge Trumbull and myself made an arrangement in 1854, by which I was to have the place of Gen. Shields in the United States Senate, and Judge Trumbull was to have the place of Judge Douglas. Now, all I have to say upon that subject is, that I think no man-not even Judge Douglas-can prove it, _because it is not true_. [Cheers.] I have no doubt he is \"_conscientious_\" in saying it. [Laughter.] As to those resolutions that he took such a length of time to read, as being the platform of the Republican party in 1854, I say I never had anything to do with them, and I think Trumbull never had. [Renewed laughter.] Judge Douglas cannot show that either of us ever did have anything to do with them. I believe _this_ is true about those resolutions: There was a call for a Convention to form a Republican party at Springfield, and I think that my friend, Mr. Lovejoy, who is here upon this stand, had a hand in it. I think this is true, and I think if he will remember accurately, he will be able to recollect that he tried to get me into it, and I would not go in. [Cheers and laughter.] I believe it is also true that I went away from Springfield when the Convention was in session, to attend court in Tazewell county. It is true they did place my name, though without authority, upon the committee, and afterward wrote me to attend the meeting of the committee, but I refused to do so, and I never had anything to do with that organization. This is the plain truth about all that matter of the resolutions.\n\nNow, about this story that Judge Douglas tells of Trumbull bargaining to sell out the old Democratic party, and Lincoln agreeing to sell out the old Whig party, I have the means of _knowing_ about that; Judge Douglas cannot have; and I know there is no substance to it whatever. Yet I have no doubt he is \"_conscientious_\" about it. I know that after Mr. Lovejoy got into the Legislature that winter, he complained of me that I had told all the old Whigs of his district that the old Whig party was good enough for them, and some of them voted against him because I told them so. Now, I have no means of totally disproving such charges as this which the Judge makes. A man cannot prove a negative, but he has a right to claim that when a man makes an affirmative charge, he must offer some proof to show the truth of what he says. I certainly cannot introduce testimony to show the negative about things, but I have a right to claim that if a man says he _knows_ a thing, then he must show _how_ he knows it. I always have a right to claim this, and it is not satisfactory to me that he may be \"conscientious\" on the subject. [Cheers and Laughter.]\n\nNow, gentlemen, I hate to waste my time on such things, but in regard to that general Abolition tilt that Judge Douglas makes, when he says that I was engaged at that time in selling out and abolitionizing the old Whig party-I hope you will permit me to read a part of a printed speech that I made then at Peoria, which will show altogether a different view of the position I took in that contest of 1854.\n\nVOICE-\"Put on your specs.\"\n\nMR. LINCOLN-Yes, sir, I am obliged to do so. I am no longer a young man. [Laughter.]\n\n\"This is the _repeal_ of the Missouri Compromise. The foregoing history may not be precisely accurate in every particular; but I am sure it is sufficiently so for all the uses I shall attempt to make of it, and in it we have before us, the chief materials enabling us to correctly judge whether the repeal of the Missouri Compromise is right or wrong.\n\n\"I think, and shall try to show, that it is wrong; wrong in its direct effect, letting slavery into Kansas and Nebraska-and wrong in its prospective principle, allowing it to spread to every other part of the wide world, where men can be found inclined to take it.\n\n\"This _declared_ indifference, but, as I must think, covert real zeal for the spread of slavery, I cannot but hate. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world-enables the enemies of free institutions, with plausibility, to taunt us as hypocrites-causes the real friends of freedom to doubt our sincerity, and especially because it forces so many really good men amongst ourselves into an open war with the very fundamental principles of civil liberty-criticizing the Declaration of Independence, and insisting that there is no right principle of action but _self-interest_.\n\n\"Before proceeding, let me say I think I have no prejudice against the Southern people. They are just what we would be in their situation. If slavery did not now exist among them, they would not introduce it. If it did now exist amongst us, we should not instantly give it up. This I believe of the masses North and South. Doubtless there are individuals on both sides, who would not hold slaves under any circumstances; and others who would gladly introduce slavery anew, if it were out of existence. We know that some Southern men do free their slaves, go North, and become tiptop Abolitionists; while some Northern ones go South, and become most cruel slave-masters.\n\n\"When Southern people tell us they are no more responsible for the origin of slavery than we, I acknowledge the fact. When it is said that the institution exists, and that it is very difficult to get rid of it, in any satisfactory way, I can understand and appreciate the saying. I surely will not blame them for not doing what I should not know how to do myself. If all earthly power were given me, I should not know what to do, as to the existing institution. My first impulse would be to free all the slaves, and send them to Liberia,-to their own native land. But a moment's reflection would convince me, that whatever of high hope, (as I think there is) there may be in this, in the long run, its sudden execution is impossible. If they were all landed there in a day, they would all perish in the next ten days; and there are not surplus shipping and surplus money enough in the world to carry them there in many times ten days. What then? Free them all, and keep them among us as underlings? Is it quite certain that this betters their condition? I think I would not hold one in slavery at any rate; yet the point is not clear enough to me to denounce people upon. What next? Free them, and make them politically and socially our equals? My own feelings will not admit of this; and if mine would, we well know that those of the great mass of white people will not. Whether this feeling accords with justice and sound judgment, is not the sole question, if, indeed, it is any part of it. A universal feeling, whether well or ill-founded, cannot be safely disregarded. We cannot, then, make them equals. It does seem to me that systems of gradual emancipation might be adopted; but for their tardiness in this, I will not undertake to judge our brethren of the South.\n\n\"When they remind us of their constitutional rights, I acknowledge them, not grudgingly, but fully and fairly; and I would give them any legislation for the reclaiming of their fugitives, which should not, in its stringency, be more likely to carry a free man into slavery, than our ordinary criminal laws are to hang an innocent one.\n\n\"But all this, to my judgment, furnishes no more excuse for permitting slavery to go into our own free territory, than it would for reviving the African slave-trade by law. The law which forbids the bringing of slaves _from_ Africa, and that which has so long forbid the taking of them _to_ Nebraska, can hardly be distinguished on any moral principle; and the repeal of the former could find quite as plausible excuses as that of the latter.\"\n\nI have reason to know that Judge Douglas _knows_ that I said this. I think he has the answer here to one of the questions he put to me. I do not mean to allow him to catechise me unless he pays back for it in kind. I will not answer questions one after another, unless he reciprocates; but as he has made this inquiry, and I have answered it before, he has got it without my getting anything in return. He has got my answer on the Fugitive Slave law.\n\nNow, gentlemen, I don't want to read at any greater length, but this is the true complexion of all I have ever said in regard to the institution of slavery and the black race. This is the whole of it, and anything that argues me into his idea of perfect social and political equality with the negro, is but a specious and fantastic arrangement of words, by which a man can prove a horse-chestnut to be a chestnut horse. [Laughter.] I will say here, while upon this subject, that I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so. I have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and the black races. There is a physical difference between the two, which, in my judgment, will probably forever forbid their living together upon the footing of perfect equality, and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity that there must be a difference, I, as well as Judge Douglas, am in favor of the race to which I belong having the superior position. I have never said anything to the contrary, but I hold that, notwithstanding all this, there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence, the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. [Loud cheers.] I hold that he is as much entitled to these as the white man. I agree with Judge Douglas he is not my equal in many respects-certainly not in color, perhaps not in moral or intellectual endowment. But in the right to eat the bread, without the leave of anybody else, which his own hand earns, _he is my equal and the equal of Judge Douglas, and the equal of every living man._ [Great applause.]\n\nNow I pass on to consider one or two more of these little follies. The Judge is wofully at fault about his early friend Lincoln being a \"grocery keeper.\" [Laughter.] I don't know as it would be a great sin, if I had been; but he is mistaken. Lincoln never kept a grocery anywhere in the world. [Laughter.] It is true that Lincoln did work the latter part of one winter in a little still house, up at the head of a hollow. [Roars of laughter.] And so I think my friend, the Judge, is equally at fault when he charges me at the time when I was in Congress of having opposed our soldiers who were fighting in the Mexican war. The Judge did not make his charge very distinctly, but I can tell you what he can prove, by referring to the record. You remember I was an old Whig, and whenever the Democratic party tried to get me to vote that the war had been righteously begun by the President, I would not do it. But whenever they asked for any money, or land-warrants, or anything to pay the soldiers there, during all that time, I gave the same vote that Judge Douglas did. [Loud applause.] You can think as you please as to whether that was consistent. Such is the truth; and the Judge has the right to make all he can out of it. But when he, by a general charge, conveys the idea that I withheld supplies from the soldiers who were fighting in the Mexican war, or did anything else to hinder the soldiers, he is, to say the least, grossly and altogether mistaken, as a consultation of the records will prove to him.\n\nAs I have not used up so much of my time as I had supposed, I will dwell a little longer upon one or two of these minor topics upon which the Judge has spoken. He has read from my speech in Springfield, in which I say that \"a house divided against itself cannot stand.\" Does the Judge say it _can_ stand? [Laughter.] I don't know whether he does or not. The Judge does not seem to be attending to me just now, but I would like to know if it is his opinion that a house divided against itself _can stand_. If he does, then there is a question of veracity, not between him and me, but between the Judge and an authority of a somewhat higher character. [Laughter and applause.]\n\nNow, my friends, I ask your attention to this matter for the purpose of saying something seriously. I know that the Judge may readily enough agree with me that the maxim which was put forth by the Saviour is true, but he may allege that I misapply it; and the Judge has a right to urge that, in my application, I do misapply it, and then I have a right to show that I do _not_ misapply it. When he undertakes to say that because I think this nation, so far as the question of slavery is concerned, will all become one thing or all the other, I am in favor of bringing about a dead uniformity in the various States, in all their institutions, he argues erroneously. The great variety of the local institutions in the States, springing from differences in the soil, differences in the face of the country, and in the climate, are bonds of Union. They do not make \"a house divided against itself,\" but they make a house united. If they produce in one section of the country what is called for by the wants of another section, and this other section can supply the wants of the first, they are not matters of discord but bonds of union, true bonds of union. But can this question of slavery be considered as among _these_ varieties in the institutions of the country? I leave it to you to say whether, in the history of our Government, this institution of slavery has not always failed to be a bond of union, and, on the contrary, been an apple of discord, and an element of division in the house. [Cries of \"Yes, yes,\" and applause.] I ask you to consider whether, so long as the moral constitution of men's minds shall continue to be the same, after this generation and assemblage shall sink into the grave, and another race shall arise, with the same moral and intellectual development we have-whether, if that institution is standing in the same irritating position in which it now is, it will not continue an element of division? [Cries of \"Yes, yes.\"] If so, then I have a right to say that, in regard to this question, the Union is a house divided against itself; and when the Judge reminds me that I have often said to him that the institution of slavery has existed for eighty years in some States, and yet it does not exist in some others, I agree to the fact, and I account for it by looking at the position in which our fathers originally placed it-restricting it from the new Territories where it had not gone, and legislating to cut off its source by the abrogation of the slave-trade thus putting the seal of legislation _against its spread_. The public mind _did_ rest in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction. [Cries of \"Yes, yes,\"] But lately, I think-and in this I charge nothing on the Judge's motives-lately, I think, that he, and those acting with him, have placed that institution on a new basis, which looks to the _perpetuity and nationalization of slavery_. [Loud cheers.] And while it is placed upon this new basis, I say, and I have said, that I believe we shall not have peace upon the question until the opponents of slavery arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction; or, on the other hand, that its advocates will push it forward until it shall become alike lawful in all the States, old as well as new, North as well as South. Now, I believe if we could arrest the spread, and place it where Washington, and Jefferson, and Madison placed it, it _would be_ in the course of ultimate extinction, and the public mind _would_, as for eighty years past, believe that it was in the course of ultimate extinction. The crisis would be past and the institution might be let alone for a hundred years, if it should live so long, in the States where it exists, yet it would be going out of existence in the way best for both the black and the white races. [Great cheering.]\n\nA VOICE- \"Then do you repudiate Popular Sovereignty?\"\n\nMR. LINCOLN-Well, then, let us talk about Popular Sovereignty! [Laughter.] What is Popular Sovereignty? [Cries of \"A humbug,\" \"a humbug.\"] Is it the right of the people to have Slavery or not have it, as they see fit, in the territories? I will state-and I have an able man to watch me-my understanding is that Popular Sovereignty, as now applied to the question of slavery, does allow the people of a Territory to have slavery if they want to, but does not allow them _not_ to have it if they _do not_ want it. [Applause and laughter.] I do not mean that if this vast concourse of people were in a Territory of the United States, any one of them would be obliged to have a slave if he did not want one; but I do say that, as I understand the Dred Scott decision, if any one man wants slaves, all the rest have no way of keeping that one man from holding them.\n\nWhen I made my speech at Springfield, of which the Judge complains, and from which he quotes, I really was not thinking of the things which he ascribes to me at all. I had no thought in the world that I was doing anything to bring about a war between the free and slave States. I had no thought in the world that I was doing anything to bring about a political and social equality of the black and white races. It never occurred to me that I was doing anything or favoring anything to reduce to a dead uniformity all the local institutions of the various States. But I must say, in all fairness to him, if he thinks I am doing something which leads to these bad results, it is none the better that I did not mean it. It is just as fatal to the country, if I have any influence in producing it, whether I intend it or not. But can it be true, that placing this institution upon the original basis-the basis upon which our fathers placed it-can have any tendency to set the Northern and the Southern States at war with one another, or that it can have any tendency to make the people of Vermont raise sugarcane, because they raise it in Louisiana, or that it can compel the people of Illinois to cut pine logs on the Grand Prairie, where they will not grow, because they cut pine logs in Maine, where they do grow? [Laughter.] The Judge says this is a new principle started in regard to this question. Does the Judge claim that he is working on the plan of the founders of Government? I think he says in some of his speeches-indeed, I have one here now-that he saw evidence of a policy to allow slavery to be south of a certain line, while north of it it should be excluded, and he saw an indisposition on the part of the country to stand upon that policy, and therefore he set about studying the subject upon _original principles_, and upon _original principles_ he got up the Nebraska bill! I am fighting it upon these _\"_ original principles''-fighting it in the Jeffersonian, Washingtonian, and Madisonian fashion. [Laughter and applause.]\n\nNow, my friends, I wish you to attend for a little while to one or two other things in that Springfield speech. My main object was to show, so far as my humble ability was capable of showing to the people of this country, what I believed was the truth-that there was a _tendency_, if not a conspiracy among those who have engineered this slavery question for the last four or five years, to make slavery perpetual and universal in this nation. Having made that speech principally for that object, after arranging the evidences that I thought tended to prove my proposition, I concluded with this bit of comment:\n\n\"We cannot absolutely know that these exact adaptations are the result of preconcert, but when we see a lot of framed timbers, different portions of which we know have been gotten out at different times and places, and by different workmen-Stephen, Franklin, Roger and James, for instance-and when we see these timbers joined together, and see they exactly make the frame of a house or a mill, all the tenons and mortices exactly fitting, and all the lengths and proportions of the different pieces exactly adapted to their respective places, and not a piece too many or too few -not omitting even the scaffolding-or if a single piece be lacking, we see the place in the frame exactly fitted and prepared yet to bring such piece in-in such a case we feel it impossible not to believe that Stephen and Franklin, and Roger and James, all understood one another from the beginning, and all worked upon a common plan or draft drawn before the first blow was struck.\" [Great cheers.]\n\nWhen my friend, Judge Douglas, came to Chicago, on the 9th of July, this speech having been delivered on the 16th of June, he made an harangue there, in which he took hold of this speech of mine, showing that he had carefully read it; and while he paid no attention to _this_ matter at all, but complimented me as being a \"kind, amiable and intelligent gentleman,\" notwithstanding I had said this, he goes on and eliminates, or draws out, from my speech this tendency of mine to set the States at war with one another, to make all the institutions uniform, and set the niggers and white people to marrying together. [Laughter.] Then, as the Judge had complimented me with these pleasant titles (I must confess to my weakness), I was a little \"taken,\" [laughter] for it came from a great man. I was not very much accustomed to flattery, and it came the sweeter to me. I was rather like the Hoosier, with the gingerbread, when he said he reckoned he loved it better than any other man, and got less of it. [Roars of laughter.] As the Judge had so flattered me, I could not make up my mind that he meant to deal unfairly with me; so I went to work to show him that he misunderstood the whole scope of my speech, and that I really never intended to set the people at war with one another. As an illustration, the next time I met him, which was at Springfield, I used this expression, that I claimed no right under the Constitution, nor had I any inclination, to enter into the Slave States and interfere with the institutions of slavery. He says upon that: Lincoln will not enter into the Slave States, but will go to the banks of the Ohio, on this side, and shoot over! [Laughter.] He runs on, step by step, in the horse-chestnut style of argument, until in the Springfield speech he says, \"Unless he shall be successful in firing his batteries, until he shall have extinguished slavery in all the States, the Union shall be dissolved.\" Now I don't think that was exactly the way to treat \"a kind, amiable, intelligent gentleman.\" I know if I had asked the Judge to show when or where it was I had said that, if I didn't succeed in firing into the slave States until slavery should be extinguished, the Union should be dissolved, he could not have shown it. I understand what he would do. He would say, \"I don't mean to quote from you, but this was the _result_ of what you say.\" But I have the right to ask, and I do ask now, Did you not put it in such a form that an ordinary reader or listener would take it as an expression _from me?_[Laughter.]\n\nIn a speech at Springfield, on the night of the 17th, I thought I might as well attend to my own business a little, and I recalled his attention as well as I could to this charge of conspiracy to nationalize slavery. I called his attention to the fact that he had acknowledged, in my hearing twice, that he had carefully read the speech, and, in the language of the lawyers, as he had twice read the speech, and still had put in no plea or answer, I took a default on him. I insisted that I had a right then to renew that charge of conspiracy. Ten days afterward I met the Judge at Clinton-that is to say, I was on the ground, but not in the discussion-and heard him make a speech. Then he comes in with his plea to this charge, for the first time, and his plea when put in, as well as I can recollect it, amounted to this: that he never had any talk with Judge Taney or the President of the United States with regard to the Dred Scott decision before it was made. I (Lincoln) ought to know that the man who makes a charge without knowing it to be true, falsifies as much as he who knowingly tells a falsehood; and lastly, that he would pronounce the whole thing a falsehood; but he would make no personal application of the charge of falsehood, not because of any regard for the \"kind, amiable, intelligent gentleman,\" but because of his own personal self-respect! [Roars of Laughter.] I have understood since then (but [turning to Judge Douglas] will not hold the Judge to it if he is not willing) that he has broken through the \"self-respect,\" and has got to saying the thing _out_. The Judge nods to me that it is so. [Laughter.] It is fortunate for me that I can keep as good-humored as I do, when the Judge acknowledges that he has been trying to make a question of veracity with me. I know the Judge is a great man, while I am only a small man, but _I feel that I have got him_. [Tremendous cheering.] I demur to that plea. I waive all objections that it was not filed till after default was taken, and demur to it upon the merits. What if Judge Douglas never did talk with Chief Justice Taney and the President, before the Dred Scott decision was made, does it follow that he could not have had as perfect an understanding without talking as with it? I am not disposed to stand upon my legal advantage. I am disposed to take his denial as being like an answer in chancery, that he neither had any knowledge, information or belief in the existence of such a conspiracy. I am disposed to take his answer as being as broad as though he had put it in these words. And now, I ask, even if he had done so, have not I a right to _prove it on him_, and to offer the evidence of more than two witnesses, by whom to prove it; and if the evidence proves the existence of the conspiracy, does his broad answer denying all knowledge, information, or belief, disturb the fact? It can only show that he was _used_ by conspirators, and was not a _leader_ of them. [Vociferous cheering.]\n\nNow, in regard to his reminding me of the moral rule that persons who tell what they do not know to be true, falsify as much as those who knowingly tell falsehoods. I remember the rule, and it must be borne in mind that in what I have read to you, I do not say that I _know_ such a conspiracy to exist. To that I reply, _I believe it_. If the Judge says that I do _not_ believe it, then _he_ says what _he_ does not know, and falls within his own rule, that he who asserts a thing which he does not know to be true, falsifies as much as he who knowingly tells a falsehood. I want to call your attention to a little discussion on that branch of the case, and the evidence which brought my mind to the conclusion which I expressed as my _belief_. If, in arraying that evidence, I had stated anything which was false or erroneous, it needed but that Judge Douglas should point it out, and I would have taken it back with all the kindness in the world. I do not deal in that way. If I have brought forward anything not a fact, if he will point it out, it will not even ruffle me to take it back. But if he will not point out anything erroneous in the evidence, is it not rather for him to show, by a comparison of the evidence, that I have _reasoned_ falsely, than to call the \"kind, amiable, intelligent gentleman\" a liar? [Cheers and laughter.] If I have reasoned to a false conclusion, it is the vocation of an able debater to show by argument that I have wandered to an erroneous conclusion. I want to ask your attention to a portion of the Nebraska bill, which Judge Douglas has quoted: \"It being the true intent and meaning of this act, not to legislate slavery into any Territory or State, nor to exclude it therefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the Constitution of the United States.\" Thereupon Judge Douglas and others began to argue in favor of \"Popular Sovereignty\" -the right of the people to have slaves if they wanted them, and to exclude slavery if they did not want them. \"But,\" said, in substance, a Senator from Ohio (Mr. Chase, I believe), \"we more than suspect that you do not mean to allow the people to exclude slavery if they wish to, and if you do mean it, accept an amendment which I propose expressly authorizing the people to exclude slavery.\" I believe I have the amendment here before me, which was offered, and under which the people of the Territory, through their proper representatives, might, if they saw fit, prohibit the existence of slavery therein. And now I state it as a _fact,_ to be taken back if there is any mistake about it, that Judge Douglas and those acting with him _voted that amendment down_. [Tremendous applause.] I now think that those men who voted it down, had a _real reason_ for doing so. They know what that reason was. It looks to us, since we have seen the Dred Scott decision pronounced, holding that, \"under the Constitution,\" the people cannot exclude slavery-I say it looks to outsiders, poor, simple, \"amiable, intelligent gentlemen,\" as though the niche was left as a place to put that Dred Scott decision in - [laughter and cheers] - a niche which would have been spoiled by adopting the amendment. And now, I say again, if _this_ was not the reason, it will avail the Judge much more to calmly and good-humoredly point out to these people what that _other_ reason was for voting the amendment down, than, swelling himself up, to vociferate that he may be provoked to call somebody a liar. [Tremendous applause.]\n\nAgain: there is in that same quotation from the Nebraska bill this clause- \"It being the true intent and meaning of this bill not to legislate slavery into any Territory or _State_.\" I have always been puzzled to know what business the word \"State\" had in that connection, Judge Douglas knows. _He put it there_. He knows what he put it there for. We outsiders cannot say what he put it there for. The law they were passing was not about States, and was not making provisions for States. What was it placed there for? After seeing the Dred Scott decision, which holds that the people cannot exclude slavery from a _Territory_, if another Dred Scott decision shall come, holding that they cannot exclude it from a _State_, we shall discover that when the word was originally put there, it was in view of something which was to come in due time, we shall see that it was the _other half_ of something. [Applause.] I now say again, if there is any different reason for putting it there, Judge Douglas, in a good humored way, without calling anybody a liar, _can tell what the reason was_. [Renewed cheers.]\n\nWhen the Judge spoke at Clinton, he came very near making a charge of falsehood against me. He used, as I found it printed in a newspaper, which, I remember, was very nearly like the real speech, the following language:\n\n\"I did not answer the charge [of conspiracy] before, for the reason that I did not suppose there was a man in America with a heart so corrupt as to believe such a charge could be true. I have too much respect for Mr. Lincoln to suppose he is serious in making the charge.\"\n\nI confess this is rather a curious view, that out of respect for me he should consider I was making what I deemed rather a grave charge in fun. [Laughter.] I confess it strikes me rather strangely. But I let it pass. As the Judge did not for a moment believe that there was a man in America whose heart was so \"corrupt\" as to make such a charge, and as he places me among the \"men in America\" who have hearts base enough to make such a charge, I hope he will excuse me if I hunt out another charge very like this; and if it should turn out that in hunting I should find that other, and it should turn out to be Judge Douglas himself who made it, I hope he will reconsider this question of the deep corruption of heart he has thought fit to ascribe to me. [Great applause and laughter.] In Judge Douglas's speech of March 22d, 1858, which I hold in my hand, he says:\n\n\"In this connection there is another topic to which I desire to allude. I seldom refer to the course of newspapers, or notice the articles which they publish in regard to myself; but the course of the Washington _Union_ has been so extraordinary, for the last two or three months, that I think it well enough to make some allusion to it. It has read me out of the Democratic party every other day, at least for two or three months, and keeps reading me out, (laughter;) and, as if it had not succeeded, still continues to read me out, using such terms as \"traitor,\" \"renegade,\" \"deserter,\" and other kind and polite epithets of that nature. Sir, I have no vindication to make of my Democracy against the Washington _Union_, or any other newspapers. I am willing to allow my history and action for the last twenty years to speak for themselves as to my political principles, and my fidelity to political obligations. The Washington _Union_ has a personal grievance. When its editor was nominated for public printer I declined to vote for him, and stated that at some time I might give my reasons for doing so. Since I declined to give that vote, this scurrilous abuse, these vindictive and constant attacks have been repeated almost daily on me. Will my friend from Michigan read the article to which I allude?\"\n\nThis is a part of the speech. You must excuse me from reading the entire article of the Washington _Union_, as Mr. Stuart read it for Mr. Douglas. The Judge goes on and sums up, as I think, correctly:\n\n\"Mr. President, you here find several distinct propositions advanced boldly by the Washington Union editorially, and apparently _authoritatively_, and any man who questions any of them is denounced as an Abolitionist, a Freesoiler, a fanatic. The propositions are, first, that the primary object of all government at its original institution is the protection of person and property; second, that the Constitution of the United States declares that the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States; and that, therefore, thirdly, all State laws, whether organic or otherwise, which prohibit the citizens of one State from settling in another with their slave property, and especially declaring it forfeited, are direct violations of the original intention of the Government and Constitution of the United States; and, fourth, that the emancipation of the slaves of the Northern States was a gross outrage on the rights of property, inasmuch as it was involuntarily done on the part of the owner.\n\n\"Remember that this article was published in the _Union_ on the 17th of November, and on the 18th appeared the first article giving the adhesion of the _Union_ to the Lecompton Constitution. It was in these words:\n\n\"KANSAS AND HER CONSTITUTION-The vexed question is settled. The problem is solved. The dead point of danger is passed. All serious trouble to Kansas affairs is over and gone'-\n\n\"And a column, nearly, of the same sort. Then, when you come to look into the Lecompton Constitution, you find the same doctrine incorporated in it which was put forth editorially in the _Union_. What is it?\n\n\" `ARTICLE 7, _Section 1_. The right of property is before and higher than any Constitutional sanction; and the right of the owner of a slave to such slave and its increase is the same and as inviolable as the right of the owner of any property whatever.'\n\n\"Then in the schedule is a provision that the Constitution may be amended after 1864 by a two-thirds vote.\n\n\"`But no alteration shall be made to affect the right of property in the ownership of slaves.'\n\n\"It will be seen by these clauses in the Lecompton Constitution, that they are identical in spirit with the _authoritative_ article in the Washington _Union_ of the day previous to its indorsement of this Constitution.\"\n\nI pass over some portions of the speech, and I hope that any one who feels interested in this matter will read the entire section of the speech, and see whether I do the Judge injustice. He proceeds: \"When I saw that article in the _Union_ of the 17th of November, followed by the glorification of the Lecompton Constitution on the 18th of November, and this clause in the Constitution asserting the doctrine that a State has no right to prohibit slavery within its limits, I saw that there was a _fatal blow_ being struck at the sovereignty of the States of this Union.\"\n\nI stop the quotation there, again requesting that it may all be read. I have read all of the portion I desire to comment upon. What is this charge that the Judge thinks I must have a very corrupt heart to make? It was a purpose on the part of certain high functionaries to make it impossible for the people of one State to prohibit the people of any other State from entering it with their \"property,\" so called, and making it a slave State. In other words, it was a charge implying a design to make the institution of slavery national. And now I ask your attention to what Judge Douglas has himself done here. I know he made that part of the speech as a reason why he had refused to vote for a certain man for public printer, but when we get at it, the charge itself is the very one I made against him, that he thinks I am so corrupt for uttering. Now, whom does he make that charge against? Does he make it against that newspaper editor merely? No; he says it is identical in spirit with the Lecompton Constitution, and so the framers of that Constitution are brought in with the editor of the newspaper in that \"fatal blow being struck.\" He did not call it a \"conspiracy.\" In his language it is a \"fatal blow being struck.\" And if the words carry the meaning better when changed from a \"conspiracy\" into a \"fatal blow being struck,\" I will change _my_ expression and call it \"fatal blow being struck.\" We see the charge made not merely against the editor of the _Union_, but all the framers of the Lecompton Constitution; and not only so, but the article was an _authoritative_ article. By whose authority? Is there any question but he means it was by the authority of the President and his Cabinet-the Administration?\n\nIs there any sort of question but he means to make that charge? Then there are the editors of the _Union_, the framers of the Lecompton Constitution, the President of the United States and his Cabinet, and all the supporters of the Lecompton Constitution, in Congress and out of Congress, who are all involved in this \"fatal blow being struck.\" I commend to Judge Douglas's consideration the question of _how corrupt a man's heart must be to make such a charge!_ [Vociferous cheering.]\n\nNow, my friends, I have but one branch of the subject, in the little time I have left, to which to call your attention, and as I shall come to a close at the end of that branch, it is probable that I shall not occupy quite all the time allotted to me. Although on these questions I would like to talk twice as long as I have, I could not enter upon another head and discuss it properly without running over my time. I ask the attention of the people here assembled and elsewhere, to the course that Judge Douglas is pursuing every day as bearing upon this question of making slavery national. Not going back to the records, but taking the speeches he makes, the speeches he made yesterday and day before, and makes constantly all over the country-I ask your attention to them. In the first place, what is necessary to make the institution national? Not war. There is no danger that the people of Kentucky will shoulder their muskets, and, with a young nigger stuck on every bayonet, march into Illinois and force them upon us. There is no danger of our going over there and making war upon them. Then what is necessary for the nationalization of slavery? It is simply the next Dred Scott decision. It is merely for the Supreme Court to decide that no _State_ under the Constitution can exclude it, just as they have already decided that under the Constitution neither Congress nor the Territorial Legislature can do it. When that is decided and acquiesced in, the whole thing is done. This being true, and this being the way, as I think, that slavery is to be made national, let us consider what Judge Douglas is doing every day to that end. In the first place, let us see what influence he is exerting on public sentiment. In this and like communities, public sentiment is everything. With public sentiment, nothing can fail; without it nothing can succeed. Consequently he who moulds public sentiment, goes deeper than he who enacts statutes or pronounces decisions. He makes statutes and decisions possible or impossible to be executed. This must be borne in mind, as also the additional fact that Judge Douglas is a man of vast influence, so great that it is enough for many men to profess to believe anything, when they once find out that Judge Douglas professes to believe it. Consider also the attitude he occupies at the head of a large party-a party which he claims has a majority of all the voters in the country. This man sticks to a decision which forbids the people of a Territory from excluding slavery, and he does so not because he says it is right in itself-he does not give any opinion on that-but because it has been _decided by the court_, and being decided by court, he is, and you are bound to take it in your political action as _law_-not that he judges at all of its merits, but because a decision of the court is to him a \"_Thus saith the Lord_.\" [Applause.] He places it on that ground alone, and you will bear in mind that, thus committing himself unreservedly to this decision, _commits him to the next one_ just as firmly as to this. He did not commit himself on account of the merit or demerit of the decision, but it is a _Thus saith the Lord_. The next decision, as much as this, will be a _Thus saith the Lord_. There is nothing that can divert or turn him away from this decision. It is nothing that I point out to him that his great prototype, Gen. Jackson, did not believe in the binding force of decisions. It is nothing to him that Jefferson did not so believe. I have said that I have often heard him approve of Jackson's course in disregarding the decision of the Supreme Court pronouncing a National Bank constitutional. He says, I did not hear him say so. He denies the accuracy of my recollection. I say he ought to know better than I, but I will make no question about this thing, though it still seems to me that I heard him say it twenty times. [Applause and laughter.] I will tell him though, that he now claims to stand on the Cincinnati platform, which affirms that Congress _cannot_ charter a National Bank, in the teeth of that old standing decision that Congress _can_ charter a bank. [Loud applause.] And I remind him of another piece of history on the question of respect for judicial decisions, and it is a piece of Illinois history, belonging to a time when the large party to which Judge Douglas belonged, were displeased with a decision of the Supreme Court of Illinois, because they had decided that a Governor could not remove a Secretary of State. You will find the whole story in Ford's History of Illinois, and I know that Judge Douglas will not deny that he was then in favor of overslaughing that decision by the mode of adding five new Judges, so as to vote down the four old ones. Not only so, but it ended in _the Judge's sitting down on that very bench as one of the five new Judges to break down the four old ones_. [Cheers and laughter.] It was in this way precisely that he got his title of Judge. Now, when the Judge tells me that men appointed conditionally to sit as members of a court, will have to be catechised beforehand upon some subject, I say, \"You know, Judge; you have tried it.\" [Laughter.] When he says a court of this kind will lose the confidence of all men, will be prostituted and disgraced by such a proceeding, I say, \"You know best, Judge; you have been through the mill.\" But I cannot shake Judge Douglas's teeth loose from the Dred Scott decision. Like some obstinate animal (I mean no disrespect), that will hang on when he has once got his teeth fixed; you may cut off a leg, or you may tear away an arm, still he will not relax his hold. And so I may point out to the Judge, and say that he is bespattered all over, from the beginning of his political life to the present time, with attacks upon judicial decisions-I may cut off limb after limb of his public record, and strive to wrench him from a single dictum of the court-yet I cannot divert him from it. He hangs, to the last, to the Dred Scott decision. [Loud cheers.] These things show there is a purpose _strong as death and eternity_ for which he adheres to this decision, and for which he will adhere to _all other decisions_ of the same court. [Vociferous applause.]\n\nA HIBERNIAN- \"Give us something besides Dred Scott.\"\n\nMR. LINCOLN-Yes; no doubt you want to hear something that don't hurt. [Laughter and applause.] Now, having spoken of the Dred Scott decision, one more word and I am done. Henry Clay, my beau ideal of a statesman, the man for whom I fought all my humble life-Henry Clay once said of a class of men who would repress all tendencies to liberty and ultimate emancipation, that they must, if they would do this, go back to the era of our Independence, and muzzle the cannon which thunders its annual joyous return; they must blow out the moral lights around us; they must penetrate the human soul, and eradicate there the love of liberty; and then, and not till then, could they perpetuate slavery in this country! [Loud cheers.] To my thinking, Judge Douglas is, by his example and vast influence, doing that very thing in this community, [cheers,] when he says that the negro has nothing in the Declaration of Independence. Henry Clay plainly understood the contrary. Judge Douglas is going back to the era of our Revolution, and to the extent of his ability, muzzling the cannon which thunders its annual joyous return. When he invites any people, willing to have slavery, to establish it, he is blowing out the moral lights around us. [Cheers.] When he says he \"cares not whether slavery is voted down or voted up''-that it is a sacred right of self-government-he is, in my judgment, penetrating the human soul and eradicating the light of reason and the love of liberty in this American people. [Enthusiastic and continued applause.] And now I will only say that when, by all these means and appliances, Judge Douglas shall succeed in bringing public sentiment to an exact accordance with his own views-when these vast assemblages shall echo back all these sentiments-when they shall come to repeat his views and to avow his principles, and to say all that he says on these mighty questions-then it needs only the formality of the second Dred Scott decision, which he indorses in advance, to make slavery alike lawful in all the States-old as well as new, North as well as South.\n\nMy friends, that ends the chapter. The Judge can take his half hour."

        "full_text_segment": "Ladies and gentlemen: I appear before you to-day for the purpose of discussing the leading political topics which now agitate the public mind. By an arrangement between Mr. Lincoln and myself, we are present here to-day for the purpose of having a joint discussion, as the representatives of the two great political parties of the State and Union, upon the principles in issue between those parties and this vast concourse of people, shows the deep feeling which pervades the public mind in regard to the questions dividing us.\n\nPrior to 1854 this country was divided into two great political parties, known as the Whig and Democratic parties. Both were national and patriotic, advocating principles that were universal in their application. An old line Whig could proclaim his principles in Louisiana and Massachusetts alike. Whig principles had no boundary sectional line, they were not limited by the Ohio river, nor by the Potomac, nor by the line of the free and slave States, but applied and were proclaimed wherever the Constitution ruled or the American flag waved over the American soil. (Hear him, and three cheers.) So it was, and so it is with the great Democratic party, which, from the days of Jefferson until this period, has proven itself to be the historic party of this nation. While the Whig and Democratic parties differed in regard to a bank, the tariff, distribution, the specie circular and the sub-treasury, they agreed on the great slavery question which now agitates the Union. I say that the Whig party and the Democratic party agreed on this slavery question, while they differed on those matters of expediency to which I have referred. The Whig party and the Democratic party jointly adopted the Compromise measures of 1850 as the basis of a proper and just solution of this slavery question in all its forms. Clay was the great leader, with Webster on his right and Cass on his left, and sustained by the patriots in the Whig and Democratic ranks, who had devised and enacted the Compromise measures of 1850.\n\nIn 1851, the Whig party and the Democratic party united in Illinois in adopting resolutions indorsing and approving the principles of the Compromise measures of 1850, as the proper adjustment of that question. In 1852, when the Whig party assembled in Convention at Baltimore for the purpose of nominating a candidate for the Presidency, the first thing it did was to declare the Compromise measures of 1850, in substance and in principle, a suitable adjustment of that question. (Here the speaker was interrupted by loud and long continued applause.) My friends, silence will be more acceptable to me in the discussion of these questions than applause. I desire to address myself to your judgment, your understanding, and your consciences, and not to your passions or your enthusiasm. When the Democratic Convention assembled in Baltimore in the same year, for the purpose of nominating a Democratic candidate for the Presidency, it also adopted the compromise measures of 1850 as the basis of Democratic action. Thus you see that up to 1853-'54, the Whig party and the Democratic party both stood on the same platform with regard to the slavery question. That platform was the right of the people of each State and each Territory to decide their local and domestic institutions for themselves, subject only to the federal constitution.\n\nDuring the session of Congress of 1853-'54, I introduced into the Senate of the United States a bill to organize the Territories of Kansas and Nebraska on that principle which had been adopted in the compromise measures of 1850, approved by the Whig party and the Democratic party in Illinois in 1851, and endorsed by the Whig party and the Democratic party in national convention in 1852. In order that there might be no misunderstanding in relation to the principle involved in the Kansas and Nebraska bill, I put forth the true intent and meaning of the act in these words: \"It is the true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any State or Territory, or to exclude it therefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the federal constitution.\" Thus, you see, that up to 1854, when the Kansas and Nebraska bill was brought into Congress for the purpose of carrying out the principles which both parties had up to that time endorsed and approved, there had been no division in this country in regard to that principle except the opposition of the abolitionists. In the House of Representatives of the Illinois Legislature, upon a resolution asserting that principle, every Whig and every Democrat in the House voted in the affirmative, and only four men voted against it, and those four were old line Abolitionists. (Cheers.)\n\nIn 1854, Mr. Abraham Lincoln and Mr. Trumbull entered into an arrangement, one with the other, and each with his respective friends, to dissolve the old Whig party on the one hand, and to dissolve the old Democratic party on the other, and to connect the members of both into an Abolition party under the name and disguise of a Republican party. (Laughter and cheers, hurrah for Douglas.) The terms of that arrangement between Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Trumbull have been published to the world by Mr. Lincoln's special friend, James H. Matheny, Esq., and they were, that Lincoln should have Shields's place in the U. S. Senate, which was then about to become vacant, and that Trumbull should have my seat when my term expired. (Great Laughter.) Lincoln went to work to abolitionize the Old Whig party all over the State, pretending that he was then as good a Whig as ever; (laughter) and Trumbull went to work in his part of the State preaching Abolitionism in its milder and lighter form, and trying to abolitionize the Democratic party, and bring old Democrats handcuffed and bound hand and foot into the Abolition camp. (\"Good,\" \"hurrah for Douglas,\" and cheers.) In pursuance of the arrangement, the parties met at Springfield in October, 1854, and proclaimed their new platform. Lincoln was to bring into the Abolition camp the old line Whigs, and transfer them over to Giddings, Chase, Fred Douglass, and Parson Lovejoy, who were ready to receive them and christen them in their new faith. (Laughter and cheers.) They laid down on that occasion a platform for their new Republican party, which was to be thus constructed. I have the resolutions of their State Convention then held, which was the first mass State Convention ever held in Illinois by the Black Republican party, and I now hold them in my hands and will read a part of them, and cause the others to be printed. Here are the most important and material resolutions of this Abolition platform:\n\n_1. Resolved_, That we believe this truth to be self-evident, that when parties become subversive of the ends for which they are established, or incapable of restoring the government to the true principles of the constitution, it is the right and duty of the people to dissolve the political bands by which they may have been connected therewith, and to organize new parties upon such principles and with such views as the circumstances and exigencies of the nation may demand.\n\n_2. Resolved_, That the times imperatively demand the reorganization of parties, and repudiating all previous party attachments, names and predilections, we unite ourselves together in defense of the liberty and constitution of the country, and will hereafter co-operate as the Republican party, pledged to the accomplishment of the following purposes: to bring the administration of the government back to the control of first principles; to restore Nebraska and Kansas to the position of free Territories; that, as the constitution of the United States, vests in the States, and not in Congress, the power to legislate for the extradition of fugitives from labor, to repeal and entirely abrogate the fugitive slave law; to restrict slavery to those States in which it exists; to prohibit the admission of any more slave States into the Union; to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia; to exclude slavery from all the territories over which the general government has exclusive jurisdiction; and to resist the acquirements of any more Territories unless the practice of slavery therein forever shall have been prohibited.\n\n_3. Resolved_, That in furtherance of these principles we will use such constitutional and lawful means as shall seem best adapted to their accomplishment, and that we will support no man for office, under the general or State Government, who is not positively and fully committed to the support of these principles, and whose personal character and conduct is not a guaranty that he is reliable, and who shall not have abjured old party allegiance and ties.\n\n(The resolutions, as they were read, were cheered throughout.)\n\nNow, gentlemen, your Black Republicans have cheered every one of those propositions, (\"good and cheers, \") and yet I venture to say that you cannot get Mr. Lincoln to come out and say that he is now in favor of each one of them. (Laughter and applause. \"Hit him again.) That these propositions, one and all, constitute the platform of the Black Republican party of this day, I have no doubt; (\"good\") and when you were not aware for what purpose I was reading them, your Black Republicans cheered them as good Black Republican doctrines. (\"That's it,\" etc.) My object in reading these resolutions, was to put the question to Abraham Lincoln this day, whether he now stands and will stand by each article in that creed and carry it out. (\"Good.\" \"Hit him again.\") I desire to know whether Mr. Lincoln today stands as he did in 1854, in favor of the unconditional repeal of the fugitive slave law. I desire him to answer whether he stands pledged to-day, as he did in 1854, against the admission of any more slave States into the Union, even if the people want them. I want to know whether he stands pledged against the admission of a new State into the Union with such a Constitution as the people of that State may see fit to make. (\"That's ot;\" \"put it at him.\") I want to know whether he stands today pledged to the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia. I desire him to answer whether he stands pledged to the prohibition of the slave trade between the different States. (\"He does.\") I desire to know whether he stands pledged to prohibit slavery in all the territories of the United States, North as well as South of the Missouri Compromise line, (\"Kansas too.\") I desire him to answer whether he is opposed to the acquisition of any more territory unless slavery is prohibited therein. I want his answer to these questions. Your affirmative cheers in favor of this Abolition platform is not satisfactory. I ask Abraham Lincoln to answer these questions, in order that when I trot him down to lower Egypt, I may put the same questions to him. (Enthusiastic applause.) My principles are the same everywhere. (Cheers and \"hark.\") I can proclaim them alike in the North, the South, the East, and the West. My principles will apply wherever the Constitution prevails and the American flag waves. (\"Good\" and applause.) I desire to know whether Mr. Lincoln's principles will bear transplanting from Ottawa to Jonesboro? I put these questions to him to-day distinctly, and ask an answer. I have a right to an answer, for I quote from the platform of the Republican party, made by himself and others at the time that party was formed, and the bargain made by Lincoln to dissolve and kill the old Whig party, and transfer its members, bound hand and foot, to the Abolition party, under the direction of Giddings and Fred Douglass. (Cheers.) In the remarks I have made on this platform, and the position of Mr. Lincoln upon it, I mean nothing personally disrespectful or unkind to that gentleman. I have known him for nearly twenty-five years. There were many points of sympathy between us when we first got acquainted. We were both comparatively boys, and both struggling with poverty in a strange land. I was a school-teacher in the town of Winchester, and he a flourishing grocery-keeper in the town of Salem. (Applause and laughter.) He was more successful in his occupation than I was in mine, and hence more fortunate in this world's goods. Lincoln is one of those peculiar men who perform with admirable skill everything which they undertake. I made as good a schoolteacher as I could, and when a cabinet maker I made a good bedstead and tables, although my old boss said I succeeded better with bureaus and secretaries than with anything else; (cheers,) but I believe that Lincoln was always more successful in business than I, for his business enabled him to get into the Legislature. I met him there, however, and had sympathy with him, because of the up-hill struggle we both had in life. He was then just as good at telling an anecdote as now. (\"No doubt.\") He could beat any of the boys wrestling, or running a foot-race, in pitching quoits or tossing a copper; could ruin more liquor than all the boys of the town together, (uproarious laughter,) and the dignity and impartiality with which he presided at a horse-race or fist-fight, excited the admiration and won the praise of everybody that was present and participated. (Renewed laughter.) I symphathised with him, because he was struggling with difficulties, and so was I. Mr. Lincoln served with me in the Legislature in 1836, when we both retired, and he subsided, or became submerged, and he was lost sight of as a public man for some years. In 1846, when Wilmot introduced his celebrated proviso, and the Abolition tornado swept over the country; Lincoln again turned up as a member of Congress from the Sangamon district. I was then in the Senate of the United States, and was glad to welcome my old friend and companion. Whilst in Congress, he distinguished himself by his opposition to the Mexican war, taking the side of the common enemy against his own country; (\"that's true,\") and when he returned home he found that the indignation of the people followed him everywhere, and he was again submerged or obliged to retire into private life, forgotten by his former friends. (\"And will be again.\") He came up again in 1854, just in time to make this Abolition or Black Republican platform, in company with Giddings, Lovejoy, Chase and Fred Douglass, for the Republican party to sand upon. (Laughter, \"Hit him again,\" &c.)Trumbull, too, was one of our own contemporaries. He was born and raised in old Connecticut, was bred a Federalist, but removing to Georgia, turned Nullifier, when nullification was popular, and as soon as he disposed of his clocks and wound up his business, migrated to Illinois, (laughter,) turned politician and lawyer here, and made his appearance in 1841, as a member of the Legislature. He became noted as the author of the scheme to repudiate a large portion of the State debt of Illinois, which, if successful, would have brought infamy and disgrace upon the fair escutcheon of our glorious State. The odium attached to that measure consigned him to oblivion for a time. I helped to do it. I walked into a public meeting in the hall of the House of Representatives, and replied to his repudiating speeches, and resolutions were carried over his head denouncing repudiation, and asserting the moral and legal obligation of Illinois to pay every dollar of the debt she owed and every bond that bore her seal. (\"Good,\" and cheers.) Trumbull's malignity has followed me since I thus defeated his infamous scheme.\n\nThese two men having formed this combination to abolitionize the old Whig party and the old Democratic party, and put themselves into the Senate of the Untied States, in pursuance of their bargain, are now carrying out that arrangement. Matheny states that Trumbull broke faith; that the bargain was that Lincoln should be the Senator in Shields's place, and Trumbull was to wait for mine; (laughter and cheers,) and the story goes, that Trumbull cheated Lincoln, having control of four or five abolitionized Democrats who were holding over in the Senate; he would not let them vote for Lincoln, and which obliged the rest of the Abolitionists to support him in order to secure an Abolition Senator. There are a number of authorities for the truth of this besides Matheny, and I suppose that even Mr. Lincoln will not deny it. (Applause and laughter.)\n\nMr. Lincoln demands that he shall have the place intended for Trumbull, as Trumbull cheated him and got his, and Trumbull is stumping the State traducing me for the purpose of securing the position for Lincoln, in order to quiet him. (\"Lincoln can never get it, &c.\") It was in consequence of this arrangement that the Republican Convention was impanneled to instruct for Lincoln and nobody else, and it was on this account that they passed resolutions that he was their first, their last, and their only choice. Archy Williams was nowhere, Browning was nobody, Wentworth was not to be considered; they had no man in the Republican party for the place except Lincoln, for the reason that he demanded that they should carry out the arrangement. (\"Hit him again.\")\n\nHaving formed this new party for the benefit of deserters from Whiggery, and deserters from Democracy, and having laid down the Abolition platform which I have read, Lincoln now takes his stand and proclaims his Abolition doctrines. Let me read a part of them. In his speech at Springfield to the Convention, which nominated him for the Senate, he said:\n\n\"In my opinion it will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed. 'A house divided against itself cannot stand.' I believe this government _cannot endure permanently half Slave and half Free_. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved-I do not expect the house to fall - _but I do expect it will cease to be divided_. It will become all one thing, or all the other. Either the opponents of slavery _will arrest the further spread of it_, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief _that it is in the course of ultimate extinction:_ or its advocates _will push it forward till it shall became alike lawful in all the States_-old as well as new, North as well as South.\"\n\n(\"Good,\" \"good,\" and cheers.)\n\nI am delighted to hear you Black Republicans say \"good.\" (Laughter and cheers.) I have no doubt that doctrine expresses your sentiments (\"hit them again,\" \"that's it,\") and I will prove to you now, if you will listen to me, that it is revolutionary and destructive of the existence of this Government. (\"Hurrah for Douglas,\" \"good,\" and cheers.) Mr. Lincoln, in the extract from which I have read, says that this Government cannot endure permanently in the same condition in which it was made by its framers-divided into free and slave States. He says that it has existed for about seventy years thus divided, and yet he tells you that it cannot endure permanently on the same principles and in the same relative condition in which our fathers made it. Why can it not exist divided into free and slave States? Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, Madison, Hamilton, Jay, and the great men of that day, made this Government divided into free States and slave States, and left each State perfectly free to do as it pleased on the subject of slavery. (\"Right, right.\") Why can it not exist on the same principles on which our fathers made it? (\"It can.\")The knew when they framed the Constitution that in a country as wide and broad as this, with such a variety of climate, production and interest, the people necessarily required different laws and institutions in different localities. They knew that the laws and regulations which would suit the granite hills of New Hampshire would be unsuited to the rice plantations of South Carolina, (\"right, right,\") and they, therefore, provided that each State should retain its own Legislature and its own sovereignty, with the full and complete power to do as it pleased within its own limits, in all that was local and not national. (Applause.) One of the reserved rights of the States, was the right to regulate the relations between Master and Servant, on the slavery question. At the time the Constitution was framed, there were thirteen States in the Union, twelve of which were slaveholding States and one free State. Suppose this doctrine of uniformity preached by Mr. Lincoln, that the States should all be free or all be slave had prevailed, and what would have been the result? Of course, the twelve slaveholding States would have overruled the one free State, and slavery would have been fastened by a Constitutional provision on every inch of the American Republic, instead of being left as our fathers wisely left it, to each State to decide for itself. (\"Good, good,\" and three cheers for Douglas.) Here I assert that uniformity in the local laws and institutions of the different States in neither possible or desirable. If uniformity had been adopted when the Government was established, it must inevitably have been the uniformity of slavery everywhere, or else the uniformity of negro citizenship and negro equality everywhere.\n\nWe are told by Lincoln that he is utterly opposed to the Dred Scott decision, and will not submit to it, for the reason that he says it deprives the negro of the rights and privileges of citizenship. (Laughter and applause.) That is the first and main reason which he assigns for his warfare on the Supreme Court of the United Sates and its decision. I ask you, are you in favor of conferring upon the negro the rights and privileges of citizenship? (\"No, no.\") Do you desire to strike out of our State Constitution that clause which keeps slaves and free negroes out of the State, and allow the free negroes to flow in, (\"never,\") and cover your prairies with black settlements? Do you desire to turn this beautiful State into a free negro colony, (\"no, no,\") in order that when Missouri abolishes slavery she can send one hundred thousand emancipated slaves into Illinois, to become citizens and voters, on an equality with yourselves? (\"Never,\" \"no.\") If you desire negro citizenship, if you desire to allow them to come into the State and settle with the white man, if you desire them to vote on an equality with yourselves, and to make them eligible to office, to serve on juries, and to adjudge your rights, then support Mr. Lincoln and the Black Republican party, who are in favor of the citizenship of the negro. (\"Never, never.\") For one, I am opposed to negro citizenship in any and every form. (Cheers.) I believe this Government was made on the white basis. (\"Good.\") I believe it was made by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity for ever, and I am in favor of confining citizenship to white men, men of European birth and descent, instead of conferring it upon negroes, Indians, and other inferior races. (\"Good for you.\" \"Douglas forever.\")\n\nMr. Lincoln, following the example and lead of all the little Abolition orators, who go around and lecture in the basements of schools and churches, reads from the Declaration of Independence, that all men were created equal, and then asks, how can you deprive a negro of that equality which God and the Declaration of Independence awards to him? He and they maintain that negro equality is guarantied by the laws of God, and that it is asserted in the Declaration of Independence. If they think so, of course they have a right to say so, and so vote. I do not question Mr. Lincoln's conscientious belief that the negro was made his equal, and hence is his brother, (laughter,) but for my own part, I do not regard the negro as my equal, and positively deny that he is my brother or any kin to me whatever. (\"Never.\" \"Hit him again,\" and cheers.) Lincoln has evidently learned by heart Parson Lovejoy's catechism. (Laughter and applause.) He can repeat it as well as Farnsworth, and he is worthy of a medal from Father Giddings and Fred Douglass for his Abolitionism. (Laughter.) He holds that the negro was born his equal and yours, and that he was endowed with equality by the Almighty, and that no human law can deprive him of these rights which were guarantied to him by the Supreme ruler of the Universe. Now, I do not believe that the Almighty ever intended the negro to be the equal of the white man. (\"Never, never.\") If he did, he has been a long time demonstrating the fact. (Cheers.) For thousands of years the negro has been a race upon the earth, and during all that time, in all latitudes and climates, wherever he has wandered or been taken, he has been inferior to the race which he has there met. He belongs to an inferior race, and must always occupy an inferior position. (\"Good,\" \"that's so,\" &c.) I do not hold that because the negro is our inferior that therefore he ought to be a slave. By no means can such a conclusion be drawn from what I have said. On the contrary, I hold that humanity and Christianity both require that the negro shall have and enjoy every right, every privilege, and every immunity consistent with the safety of the society in which he lives. (That's so.) On that point, I presume, there can be no diversity of opinion. You and I are bound to extend to our inferior and dependent beings every right, every privilege, every facility and immunity consistent with the public good. The question then arises, what rights and privileges are consistent with the public good? This is a question which each State and each Territory must decide for itself-Illinois has decided it for herself. We have provided that the negro shall not be a slave, and we have also provided that he shall not be a citizen, but protect him in his civil rights, in his life, his person and his property, only depriving him of all political rights whatsoever, and refusing to put him on an equality with the white man. (\"Good.\") That policy of Illinois is satisfactory to the Democratic party and to me, and if it were to the Republicans, there would then be no question upon the subject; but the Republicans say that he ought to be made a citizen, and when he becomes a citizen he becomes your equal, with all your rights and privileges. (\"He never shall.\") They assert the Dred Scott decision to be monstrous because it denies that the negro is or can be a citizen under the Constitution. Now, I hold that Illinois had a right to abolish and prohibit slavery as she did, and I hold that Kentucky has the same right to continue and protect slavery that Illinois had to abolish it. I hold that New York had as much right to abolish slavery as Virginia has to continue it, and that each and every State of this Union is a sovereign power, with the right to do as it pleases upon this question of slavery, and upon all its domestic institutions. Slavery is not the only question which comes up in this controversy. There is a far more important one to you, and that is, what shall be done with the free negro? We have settled the slavery question as far as we are concerned; we have prohibited it in Illinois forever, and in doing so, I think we have done wisely, and there is no man in the State who would be more strenuous in his opposition to the introduction of slavery than I would; (cheers) but when we settled it for ourselves, we exhausted all our power over that subject. We have done our whole duty, and can do no more. We must leave each and every other State to decide for itself the same question. In relation to the policy to be pursued toward the free negroes, we have said that they shall not vote; whilst Maine, on the other hand, has said that they shall vote. Maine is a sovereign State, and has the power to regulate the qualifications of voters within her limits. I would never consent to confer the right of voting and of citizenship upon a negro, but still I am not going to quarrel with Maine for differing from me in opinion. Let Maine take care of her own negroes and fix the qualifications of her own voters to suit herself, without interfering with Illinois, and Illinois will not interfere with Maine. So with the State of New York. She allows the negro to vote provided he owns two hundred and fifty dollars' worth of property, but not otherwise. While I would not make any distinction whatever between a negro who held property and one who did not; yet if the sovereign State of New York chooses to make that distinction it is her business and not mine, and I will not quarrel with her for it. She can do as she pleases on this question if she minds her own business, and we will do the same thing. Now, my friends, if we will only act conscientiously and rigidly upon this great principle of popular sovereignty, which guaranties to each State and Territory the right to do as it pleases on all things, local and domestic, instead of Congress interfering, we will continue at peace one with another. Why should Illinois be at war with Missouri, or Kentucky with Ohio, or Virginia with New York, merely because their institutions differ? Our fathers intended that our institutions should differ. They knew that the North and the South, having different climates, productions and interests, required different institutions. This doctrine of Mr. Lincoln, of uniformity among the institutions of the different States, is a new doctrine, never dreamed of by Washington, Madison, or the framers of this Government. Mr. Lincoln and the Republican party set themselves up as wiser than these men who made this Government, which has flourished for seventy years under the principle of popular sovereignty, recognizing the right of each State to do as it pleased. Under that principle, we have grown from a nation of three or four millions to a nation of about thirty millions of people; we have crossed the Allegheny mountains and filled up the whole North-west, turning the prairie into a garden, and building up churches and schools, thus spreading civilization and Christianity where before there was nothing but savage barbarism. Under that principle we have become, from a feeble nation, the most powerful on the face of the earth, and if we only adhere to that principle, we can go forward increasing in territory, in power, in strength and in glory until the Republic of America shall be the North Star that shall guide the friends of freedom throughout the civilized world. (\"Long may you live,\" and great applause.) And why can we not adhere to the great principle of self-government, upon which our institutions were originally based. (\"We can.\") I believe that this new doctrine preached by Mr. Lincoln and his party will dissolve the Union if it succeeds. They are trying to array all the Northern States in one body against the South, to excite a sectional war between the free States and the slave States, in order that the one or the other may be driven to the wall.\n\nI am told that my time is out. Mr. Lincoln will now address you for an hour and a half, and I will then occupy an half hour in replying to him."

I have never said anything to the contrary, but I hold that, notwithstanding all this, there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence, the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

    "full_text": "**August 21, 1858**\n\nIt was dry and dusty, between 10,000 and 12,000 people were in attendance when the debate began at 2:00 p.m. There were no seats or bleachers.\n\nDouglas charged Lincoln with trying to “abolitionize” the Whig and Democratic Parties. He also charged Lincoln had been present when a very radical “abolitionist” type platform had been written by the Republican Party in 1854. Douglas accused Lincoln of taking the side of the common enemy in the Mexican War. Douglas also said Lincoln wanted to make Illinois “a free Negro colony.” Douglas asked Lincoln seven questions.\n\nLincoln during his turn did not respond to the questions and was on the defensive denying the allegations Douglas had made. Lincoln charged Douglas with trying to nationalize slavery.\n\nIn his rebuttal Douglas concentrated on the charge that Lincoln had been present when a very radical “abolitionist” type platform had been written by the Republican Party in 1854.\n\nSource: Neely, Mark E. Jr. 1982. _The Abraham Lincoln Encyclopedia_. New York: Da Capo Press, Inc.\n\nFull text of the Ottawa Debate follows.\n\n**Mr. Douglas' Speech**\n\nLadies and gentlemen: I appear before you to-day for the purpose of discussing the leading political topics which now agitate the public mind. By an arrangement between Mr. Lincoln and myself, we are present here to-day for the purpose of having a joint discussion, as the representatives of the two great political parties of the State and Union, upon the principles in issue between those parties and this vast concourse of people, shows the deep feeling which pervades the public mind in regard to the questions dividing us.\n\nPrior to 1854 this country was divided into two great political parties, known as the Whig and Democratic parties. Both were national and patriotic, advocating principles that were universal in their application. An old line Whig could proclaim his principles in Louisiana and Massachusetts alike. Whig principles had no boundary sectional line, they were not limited by the Ohio river, nor by the Potomac, nor by the line of the free and slave States, but applied and were proclaimed wherever the Constitution ruled or the American flag waved over the American soil. (Hear him, and three cheers.) So it was, and so it is with the great Democratic party, which, from the days of Jefferson until this period, has proven itself to be the historic party of this nation. While the Whig and Democratic parties differed in regard to a bank, the tariff, distribution, the specie circular and the sub-treasury, they agreed on the great slavery question which now agitates the Union. I say that the Whig party and the Democratic party agreed on this slavery question, while they differed on those matters of expediency to which I have referred. The Whig party and the Democratic party jointly adopted the Compromise measures of 1850 as the basis of a proper and just solution of this slavery question in all its forms. Clay was the great leader, with Webster on his right and Cass on his left, and sustained by the patriots in the Whig and Democratic ranks, who had devised and enacted the Compromise measures of 1850.\n\nIn 1851, the Whig party and the Democratic party united in Illinois in adopting resolutions indorsing and approving the principles of the Compromise measures of 1850, as the proper adjustment of that question. In 1852, when the Whig party assembled in Convention at Baltimore for the purpose of nominating a candidate for the Presidency, the first thing it did was to declare the Compromise measures of 1850, in substance and in principle, a suitable adjustment of that question. (Here the speaker was interrupted by loud and long continued applause.) My friends, silence will be more acceptable to me in the discussion of these questions than applause. I desire to address myself to your judgment, your understanding, and your consciences, and not to your passions or your enthusiasm. When the Democratic Convention assembled in Baltimore in the same year, for the purpose of nominating a Democratic candidate for the Presidency, it also adopted the compromise measures of 1850 as the basis of Democratic action. Thus you see that up to 1853-'54, the Whig party and the Democratic party both stood on the same platform with regard to the slavery question. That platform was the right of the people of each State and each Territory to decide their local and domestic institutions for themselves, subject only to the federal constitution.\n\nDuring the session of Congress of 1853-'54, I introduced into the Senate of the United States a bill to organize the Territories of Kansas and Nebraska on that principle which had been adopted in the compromise measures of 1850, approved by the Whig party and the Democratic party in Illinois in 1851, and endorsed by the Whig party and the Democratic party in national convention in 1852. In order that there might be no misunderstanding in relation to the principle involved in the Kansas and Nebraska bill, I put forth the true intent and meaning of the act in these words: \"It is the true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any State or Territory, or to exclude it therefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the federal constitution.\" Thus, you see, that up to 1854, when the Kansas and Nebraska bill was brought into Congress for the purpose of carrying out the principles which both parties had up to that time endorsed and approved, there had been no division in this country in regard to that principle except the opposition of the abolitionists. In the House of Representatives of the Illinois Legislature, upon a resolution asserting that principle, every Whig and every Democrat in the House voted in the affirmative, and only four men voted against it, and those four were old line Abolitionists. (Cheers.)\n\nIn 1854, Mr. Abraham Lincoln and Mr. Trumbull entered into an arrangement, one with the other, and each with his respective friends, to dissolve the old Whig party on the one hand, and to dissolve the old Democratic party on the other, and to connect the members of both into an Abolition party under the name and disguise of a Republican party. (Laughter and cheers, hurrah for Douglas.) The terms of that arrangement between Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Trumbull have been published to the world by Mr. Lincoln's special friend, James H. Matheny, Esq., and they were, that Lincoln should have Shields's place in the U. S. Senate, which was then about to become vacant, and that Trumbull should have my seat when my term expired. (Great Laughter.) Lincoln went to work to abolitionize the Old Whig party all over the State, pretending that he was then as good a Whig as ever; (laughter) and Trumbull went to work in his part of the State preaching Abolitionism in its milder and lighter form, and trying to abolitionize the Democratic party, and bring old Democrats handcuffed and bound hand and foot into the Abolition camp. (\"Good,\" \"hurrah for Douglas,\" and cheers.) In pursuance of the arrangement, the parties met at Springfield in October, 1854, and proclaimed their new platform. Lincoln was to bring into the Abolition camp the old line Whigs, and transfer them over to Giddings, Chase, Fred Douglass, and Parson Lovejoy, who were ready to receive them and christen them in their new faith. (Laughter and cheers.) They laid down on that occasion a platform for their new Republican party, which was to be thus constructed. I have the resolutions of their State Convention then held, which was the first mass State Convention ever held in Illinois by the Black Republican party, and I now hold them in my hands and will read a part of them, and cause the others to be printed. Here are the most important and material resolutions of this Abolition platform:\n\n_1. Resolved_, That we believe this truth to be self-evident, that when parties become subversive of the ends for which they are established, or incapable of restoring the government to the true principles of the constitution, it is the right and duty of the people to dissolve the political bands by which they may have been connected therewith, and to organize new parties upon such principles and with such views as the circumstances and exigencies of the nation may demand.\n\n_2. Resolved_, That the times imperatively demand the reorganization of parties, and repudiating all previous party attachments, names and predilections, we unite ourselves together in defense of the liberty and constitution of the country, and will hereafter co-operate as the Republican party, pledged to the accomplishment of the following purposes: to bring the administration of the government back to the control of first principles; to restore Nebraska and Kansas to the position of free Territories; that, as the constitution of the United States, vests in the States, and not in Congress, the power to legislate for the extradition of fugitives from labor, to repeal and entirely abrogate the fugitive slave law; to restrict slavery to those States in which it exists; to prohibit the admission of any more slave States into the Union; to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia; to exclude slavery from all the territories over which the general government has exclusive jurisdiction; and to resist the acquirements of any more Territories unless the practice of slavery therein forever shall have been prohibited.\n\n_3. Resolved_, That in furtherance of these principles we will use such constitutional and lawful means as shall seem best adapted to their accomplishment, and that we will support no man for office, under the general or State Government, who is not positively and fully committed to the support of these principles, and whose personal character and conduct is not a guaranty that he is reliable, and who shall not have abjured old party allegiance and ties.\n\n(The resolutions, as they were read, were cheered throughout.)\n\nNow, gentlemen, your Black Republicans have cheered every one of those propositions, (\"good and cheers, \") and yet I venture to say that you cannot get Mr. Lincoln to come out and say that he is now in favor of each one of them. (Laughter and applause. \"Hit him again.) That these propositions, one and all, constitute the platform of the Black Republican party of this day, I have no doubt; (\"good\") and when you were not aware for what purpose I was reading them, your Black Republicans cheered them as good Black Republican doctrines. (\"That's it,\" etc.) My object in reading these resolutions, was to put the question to Abraham Lincoln this day, whether he now stands and will stand by each article in that creed and carry it out. (\"Good.\" \"Hit him again.\") I desire to know whether Mr. Lincoln today stands as he did in 1854, in favor of the unconditional repeal of the fugitive slave law. I desire him to answer whether he stands pledged to-day, as he did in 1854, against the admission of any more slave States into the Union, even if the people want them. I want to know whether he stands pledged against the admission of a new State into the Union with such a Constitution as the people of that State may see fit to make. (\"That's ot;\" \"put it at him.\") I want to know whether he stands today pledged to the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia. I desire him to answer whether he stands pledged to the prohibition of the slave trade between the different States. (\"He does.\") I desire to know whether he stands pledged to prohibit slavery in all the territories of the United States, North as well as South of the Missouri Compromise line, (\"Kansas too.\") I desire him to answer whether he is opposed to the acquisition of any more territory unless slavery is prohibited therein. I want his answer to these questions. Your affirmative cheers in favor of this Abolition platform is not satisfactory. I ask Abraham Lincoln to answer these questions, in order that when I trot him down to lower Egypt, I may put the same questions to him. (Enthusiastic applause.) My principles are the same everywhere. (Cheers and \"hark.\") I can proclaim them alike in the North, the South, the East, and the West. My principles will apply wherever the Constitution prevails and the American flag waves. (\"Good\" and applause.) I desire to know whether Mr. Lincoln's principles will bear transplanting from Ottawa to Jonesboro? I put these questions to him to-day distinctly, and ask an answer. I have a right to an answer, for I quote from the platform of the Republican party, made by himself and others at the time that party was formed, and the bargain made by Lincoln to dissolve and kill the old Whig party, and transfer its members, bound hand and foot, to the Abolition party, under the direction of Giddings and Fred Douglass. (Cheers.) In the remarks I have made on this platform, and the position of Mr. Lincoln upon it, I mean nothing personally disrespectful or unkind to that gentleman. I have known him for nearly twenty-five years. There were many points of sympathy between us when we first got acquainted. We were both comparatively boys, and both struggling with poverty in a strange land. I was a school-teacher in the town of Winchester, and he a flourishing grocery-keeper in the town of Salem. (Applause and laughter.) He was more successful in his occupation than I was in mine, and hence more fortunate in this world's goods. Lincoln is one of those peculiar men who perform with admirable skill everything which they undertake. I made as good a schoolteacher as I could, and when a cabinet maker I made a good bedstead and tables, although my old boss said I succeeded better with bureaus and secretaries than with anything else; (cheers,) but I believe that Lincoln was always more successful in business than I, for his business enabled him to get into the Legislature. I met him there, however, and had sympathy with him, because of the up-hill struggle we both had in life. He was then just as good at telling an anecdote as now. (\"No doubt.\") He could beat any of the boys wrestling, or running a foot-race, in pitching quoits or tossing a copper; could ruin more liquor than all the boys of the town together, (uproarious laughter,) and the dignity and impartiality with which he presided at a horse-race or fist-fight, excited the admiration and won the praise of everybody that was present and participated. (Renewed laughter.) I symphathised with him, because he was struggling with difficulties, and so was I. Mr. Lincoln served with me in the Legislature in 1836, when we both retired, and he subsided, or became submerged, and he was lost sight of as a public man for some years. In 1846, when Wilmot introduced his celebrated proviso, and the Abolition tornado swept over the country; Lincoln again turned up as a member of Congress from the Sangamon district. I was then in the Senate of the United States, and was glad to welcome my old friend and companion. Whilst in Congress, he distinguished himself by his opposition to the Mexican war, taking the side of the common enemy against his own country; (\"that's true,\") and when he returned home he found that the indignation of the people followed him everywhere, and he was again submerged or obliged to retire into private life, forgotten by his former friends. (\"And will be again.\") He came up again in 1854, just in time to make this Abolition or Black Republican platform, in company with Giddings, Lovejoy, Chase and Fred Douglass, for the Republican party to sand upon. (Laughter, \"Hit him again,\" &c.)Trumbull, too, was one of our own contemporaries. He was born and raised in old Connecticut, was bred a Federalist, but removing to Georgia, turned Nullifier, when nullification was popular, and as soon as he disposed of his clocks and wound up his business, migrated to Illinois, (laughter,) turned politician and lawyer here, and made his appearance in 1841, as a member of the Legislature. He became noted as the author of the scheme to repudiate a large portion of the State debt of Illinois, which, if successful, would have brought infamy and disgrace upon the fair escutcheon of our glorious State. The odium attached to that measure consigned him to oblivion for a time. I helped to do it. I walked into a public meeting in the hall of the House of Representatives, and replied to his repudiating speeches, and resolutions were carried over his head denouncing repudiation, and asserting the moral and legal obligation of Illinois to pay every dollar of the debt she owed and every bond that bore her seal. (\"Good,\" and cheers.) Trumbull's malignity has followed me since I thus defeated his infamous scheme.\n\nThese two men having formed this combination to abolitionize the old Whig party and the old Democratic party, and put themselves into the Senate of the Untied States, in pursuance of their bargain, are now carrying out that arrangement. Matheny states that Trumbull broke faith; that the bargain was that Lincoln should be the Senator in Shields's place, and Trumbull was to wait for mine; (laughter and cheers,) and the story goes, that Trumbull cheated Lincoln, having control of four or five abolitionized Democrats who were holding over in the Senate; he would not let them vote for Lincoln, and which obliged the rest of the Abolitionists to support him in order to secure an Abolition Senator. There are a number of authorities for the truth of this besides Matheny, and I suppose that even Mr. Lincoln will not deny it. (Applause and laughter.)\n\nMr. Lincoln demands that he shall have the place intended for Trumbull, as Trumbull cheated him and got his, and Trumbull is stumping the State traducing me for the purpose of securing the position for Lincoln, in order to quiet him. (\"Lincoln can never get it, &c.\") It was in consequence of this arrangement that the Republican Convention was impanneled to instruct for Lincoln and nobody else, and it was on this account that they passed resolutions that he was their first, their last, and their only choice. Archy Williams was nowhere, Browning was nobody, Wentworth was not to be considered; they had no man in the Republican party for the place except Lincoln, for the reason that he demanded that they should carry out the arrangement. (\"Hit him again.\")\n\nHaving formed this new party for the benefit of deserters from Whiggery, and deserters from Democracy, and having laid down the Abolition platform which I have read, Lincoln now takes his stand and proclaims his Abolition doctrines. Let me read a part of them. In his speech at Springfield to the Convention, which nominated him for the Senate, he said:\n\n\"In my opinion it will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed. 'A house divided against itself cannot stand.' I believe this government _cannot endure permanently half Slave and half Free_. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved-I do not expect the house to fall - _but I do expect it will cease to be divided_. It will become all one thing, or all the other. Either the opponents of slavery _will arrest the further spread of it_, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief _that it is in the course of ultimate extinction:_ or its advocates _will push it forward till it shall became alike lawful in all the States_-old as well as new, North as well as South.\"\n\n(\"Good,\" \"good,\" and cheers.)\n\nI am delighted to hear you Black Republicans say \"good.\" (Laughter and cheers.) I have no doubt that doctrine expresses your sentiments (\"hit them again,\" \"that's it,\") and I will prove to you now, if you will listen to me, that it is revolutionary and destructive of the existence of this Government. (\"Hurrah for Douglas,\" \"good,\" and cheers.) Mr. Lincoln, in the extract from which I have read, says that this Government cannot endure permanently in the same condition in which it was made by its framers-divided into free and slave States. He says that it has existed for about seventy years thus divided, and yet he tells you that it cannot endure permanently on the same principles and in the same relative condition in which our fathers made it. Why can it not exist divided into free and slave States? Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, Madison, Hamilton, Jay, and the great men of that day, made this Government divided into free States and slave States, and left each State perfectly free to do as it pleased on the subject of slavery. (\"Right, right.\") Why can it not exist on the same principles on which our fathers made it? (\"It can.\")The knew when they framed the Constitution that in a country as wide and broad as this, with such a variety of climate, production and interest, the people necessarily required different laws and institutions in different localities. They knew that the laws and regulations which would suit the granite hills of New Hampshire would be unsuited to the rice plantations of South Carolina, (\"right, right,\") and they, therefore, provided that each State should retain its own Legislature and its own sovereignty, with the full and complete power to do as it pleased within its own limits, in all that was local and not national. (Applause.) One of the reserved rights of the States, was the right to regulate the relations between Master and Servant, on the slavery question. At the time the Constitution was framed, there were thirteen States in the Union, twelve of which were slaveholding States and one free State. Suppose this doctrine of uniformity preached by Mr. Lincoln, that the States should all be free or all be slave had prevailed, and what would have been the result? Of course, the twelve slaveholding States would have overruled the one free State, and slavery would have been fastened by a Constitutional provision on every inch of the American Republic, instead of being left as our fathers wisely left it, to each State to decide for itself. (\"Good, good,\" and three cheers for Douglas.) Here I assert that uniformity in the local laws and institutions of the different States in neither possible or desirable. If uniformity had been adopted when the Government was established, it must inevitably have been the uniformity of slavery everywhere, or else the uniformity of negro citizenship and negro equality everywhere.\n\nWe are told by Lincoln that he is utterly opposed to the Dred Scott decision, and will not submit to it, for the reason that he says it deprives the negro of the rights and privileges of citizenship. (Laughter and applause.) That is the first and main reason which he assigns for his warfare on the Supreme Court of the United Sates and its decision. I ask you, are you in favor of conferring upon the negro the rights and privileges of citizenship? (\"No, no.\") Do you desire to strike out of our State Constitution that clause which keeps slaves and free negroes out of the State, and allow the free negroes to flow in, (\"never,\") and cover your prairies with black settlements? Do you desire to turn this beautiful State into a free negro colony, (\"no, no,\") in order that when Missouri abolishes slavery she can send one hundred thousand emancipated slaves into Illinois, to become citizens and voters, on an equality with yourselves? (\"Never,\" \"no.\") If you desire negro citizenship, if you desire to allow them to come into the State and settle with the white man, if you desire them to vote on an equality with yourselves, and to make them eligible to office, to serve on juries, and to adjudge your rights, then support Mr. Lincoln and the Black Republican party, who are in favor of the citizenship of the negro. (\"Never, never.\") For one, I am opposed to negro citizenship in any and every form. (Cheers.) I believe this Government was made on the white basis. (\"Good.\") I believe it was made by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity for ever, and I am in favor of confining citizenship to white men, men of European birth and descent, instead of conferring it upon negroes, Indians, and other inferior races. (\"Good for you.\" \"Douglas forever.\")\n\nMr. Lincoln, following the example and lead of all the little Abolition orators, who go around and lecture in the basements of schools and churches, reads from the Declaration of Independence, that all men were created equal, and then asks, how can you deprive a negro of that equality which God and the Declaration of Independence awards to him? He and they maintain that negro equality is guarantied by the laws of God, and that it is asserted in the Declaration of Independence. If they think so, of course they have a right to say so, and so vote. I do not question Mr. Lincoln's conscientious belief that the negro was made his equal, and hence is his brother, (laughter,) but for my own part, I do not regard the negro as my equal, and positively deny that he is my brother or any kin to me whatever. (\"Never.\" \"Hit him again,\" and cheers.) Lincoln has evidently learned by heart Parson Lovejoy's catechism. (Laughter and applause.) He can repeat it as well as Farnsworth, and he is worthy of a medal from Father Giddings and Fred Douglass for his Abolitionism. (Laughter.) He holds that the negro was born his equal and yours, and that he was endowed with equality by the Almighty, and that no human law can deprive him of these rights which were guarantied to him by the Supreme ruler of the Universe. Now, I do not believe that the Almighty ever intended the negro to be the equal of the white man. (\"Never, never.\") If he did, he has been a long time demonstrating the fact. (Cheers.) For thousands of years the negro has been a race upon the earth, and during all that time, in all latitudes and climates, wherever he has wandered or been taken, he has been inferior to the race which he has there met. He belongs to an inferior race, and must always occupy an inferior position. (\"Good,\" \"that's so,\" &c.) I do not hold that because the negro is our inferior that therefore he ought to be a slave. By no means can such a conclusion be drawn from what I have said. On the contrary, I hold that humanity and Christianity both require that the negro shall have and enjoy every right, every privilege, and every immunity consistent with the safety of the society in which he lives. (That's so.) On that point, I presume, there can be no diversity of opinion. You and I are bound to extend to our inferior and dependent beings every right, every privilege, every facility and immunity consistent with the public good. The question then arises, what rights and privileges are consistent with the public good? This is a question which each State and each Territory must decide for itself-Illinois has decided it for herself. We have provided that the negro shall not be a slave, and we have also provided that he shall not be a citizen, but protect him in his civil rights, in his life, his person and his property, only depriving him of all political rights whatsoever, and refusing to put him on an equality with the white man. (\"Good.\") That policy of Illinois is satisfactory to the Democratic party and to me, and if it were to the Republicans, there would then be no question upon the subject; but the Republicans say that he ought to be made a citizen, and when he becomes a citizen he becomes your equal, with all your rights and privileges. (\"He never shall.\") They assert the Dred Scott decision to be monstrous because it denies that the negro is or can be a citizen under the Constitution. Now, I hold that Illinois had a right to abolish and prohibit slavery as she did, and I hold that Kentucky has the same right to continue and protect slavery that Illinois had to abolish it. I hold that New York had as much right to abolish slavery as Virginia has to continue it, and that each and every State of this Union is a sovereign power, with the right to do as it pleases upon this question of slavery, and upon all its domestic institutions. Slavery is not the only question which comes up in this controversy. There is a far more important one to you, and that is, what shall be done with the free negro? We have settled the slavery question as far as we are concerned; we have prohibited it in Illinois forever, and in doing so, I think we have done wisely, and there is no man in the State who would be more strenuous in his opposition to the introduction of slavery than I would; (cheers) but when we settled it for ourselves, we exhausted all our power over that subject. We have done our whole duty, and can do no more. We must leave each and every other State to decide for itself the same question. In relation to the policy to be pursued toward the free negroes, we have said that they shall not vote; whilst Maine, on the other hand, has said that they shall vote. Maine is a sovereign State, and has the power to regulate the qualifications of voters within her limits. I would never consent to confer the right of voting and of citizenship upon a negro, but still I am not going to quarrel with Maine for differing from me in opinion. Let Maine take care of her own negroes and fix the qualifications of her own voters to suit herself, without interfering with Illinois, and Illinois will not interfere with Maine. So with the State of New York. She allows the negro to vote provided he owns two hundred and fifty dollars' worth of property, but not otherwise. While I would not make any distinction whatever between a negro who held property and one who did not; yet if the sovereign State of New York chooses to make that distinction it is her business and not mine, and I will not quarrel with her for it. She can do as she pleases on this question if she minds her own business, and we will do the same thing. Now, my friends, if we will only act conscientiously and rigidly upon this great principle of popular sovereignty, which guaranties to each State and Territory the right to do as it pleases on all things, local and domestic, instead of Congress interfering, we will continue at peace one with another. Why should Illinois be at war with Missouri, or Kentucky with Ohio, or Virginia with New York, merely because their institutions differ? Our fathers intended that our institutions should differ. They knew that the North and the South, having different climates, productions and interests, required different institutions. This doctrine of Mr. Lincoln, of uniformity among the institutions of the different States, is a new doctrine, never dreamed of by Washington, Madison, or the framers of this Government. Mr. Lincoln and the Republican party set themselves up as wiser than these men who made this Government, which has flourished for seventy years under the principle of popular sovereignty, recognizing the right of each State to do as it pleased. Under that principle, we have grown from a nation of three or four millions to a nation of about thirty millions of people; we have crossed the Allegheny mountains and filled up the whole North-west, turning the prairie into a garden, and building up churches and schools, thus spreading civilization and Christianity where before there was nothing but savage barbarism. Under that principle we have become, from a feeble nation, the most powerful on the face of the earth, and if we only adhere to that principle, we can go forward increasing in territory, in power, in strength and in glory until the Republic of America shall be the North Star that shall guide the friends of freedom throughout the civilized world. (\"Long may you live,\" and great applause.) And why can we not adhere to the great principle of self-government, upon which our institutions were originally based. (\"We can.\") I believe that this new doctrine preached by Mr. Lincoln and his party will dissolve the Union if it succeeds. They are trying to array all the Northern States in one body against the South, to excite a sectional war between the free States and the slave States, in order that the one or the other may be driven to the wall.\n\nI am told that my time is out. Mr. Lincoln will now address you for an hour and a half, and I will then occupy an half hour in replying to him.\n\n**Mr. Lincoln's Speech**\n\nMr. Lincoln then came forward and was greeted with loud and protracted cheers from fully two-thirds of the audience. This was admitted by the Douglas men on the platform. It was some minutes before he could make himself heard, even by those on the stand. At last he said:\n\nMY FELLOW-CITIZENS: When a man hears himself somewhat misrepresented, it provokes him-at least, I find it so with myself; but when misrepresentation becomes very gross and palpable, it is more apt to amuse him. The first thing I see fit to notice, is the fact that Judge Douglas alleges, after running through the history of the old Democratic and the old Whig parties, that Judge Trumbull and myself made an arrangement in 1854, by which I was to have the place of Gen. Shields in the United States Senate, and Judge Trumbull was to have the place of Judge Douglas. Now, all I have to say upon that subject is, that I think no man-not even Judge Douglas-can prove it, _because it is not true_. [Cheers.] I have no doubt he is \"_conscientious_\" in saying it. [Laughter.] As to those resolutions that he took such a length of time to read, as being the platform of the Republican party in 1854, I say I never had anything to do with them, and I think Trumbull never had. [Renewed laughter.] Judge Douglas cannot show that either of us ever did have anything to do with them. I believe _this_ is true about those resolutions: There was a call for a Convention to form a Republican party at Springfield, and I think that my friend, Mr. Lovejoy, who is here upon this stand, had a hand in it. I think this is true, and I think if he will remember accurately, he will be able to recollect that he tried to get me into it, and I would not go in. [Cheers and laughter.] I believe it is also true that I went away from Springfield when the Convention was in session, to attend court in Tazewell county. It is true they did place my name, though without authority, upon the committee, and afterward wrote me to attend the meeting of the committee, but I refused to do so, and I never had anything to do with that organization. This is the plain truth about all that matter of the resolutions.\n\nNow, about this story that Judge Douglas tells of Trumbull bargaining to sell out the old Democratic party, and Lincoln agreeing to sell out the old Whig party, I have the means of _knowing_ about that; Judge Douglas cannot have; and I know there is no substance to it whatever. Yet I have no doubt he is \"_conscientious_\" about it. I know that after Mr. Lovejoy got into the Legislature that winter, he complained of me that I had told all the old Whigs of his district that the old Whig party was good enough for them, and some of them voted against him because I told them so. Now, I have no means of totally disproving such charges as this which the Judge makes. A man cannot prove a negative, but he has a right to claim that when a man makes an affirmative charge, he must offer some proof to show the truth of what he says. I certainly cannot introduce testimony to show the negative about things, but I have a right to claim that if a man says he _knows_ a thing, then he must show _how_ he knows it. I always have a right to claim this, and it is not satisfactory to me that he may be \"conscientious\" on the subject. [Cheers and Laughter.]\n\nNow, gentlemen, I hate to waste my time on such things, but in regard to that general Abolition tilt that Judge Douglas makes, when he says that I was engaged at that time in selling out and abolitionizing the old Whig party-I hope you will permit me to read a part of a printed speech that I made then at Peoria, which will show altogether a different view of the position I took in that contest of 1854.\n\nVOICE-\"Put on your specs.\"\n\nMR. LINCOLN-Yes, sir, I am obliged to do so. I am no longer a young man. [Laughter.]\n\n\"This is the _repeal_ of the Missouri Compromise. The foregoing history may not be precisely accurate in every particular; but I am sure it is sufficiently so for all the uses I shall attempt to make of it, and in it we have before us, the chief materials enabling us to correctly judge whether the repeal of the Missouri Compromise is right or wrong.\n\n\"I think, and shall try to show, that it is wrong; wrong in its direct effect, letting slavery into Kansas and Nebraska-and wrong in its prospective principle, allowing it to spread to every other part of the wide world, where men can be found inclined to take it.\n\n\"This _declared_ indifference, but, as I must think, covert real zeal for the spread of slavery, I cannot but hate. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world-enables the enemies of free institutions, with plausibility, to taunt us as hypocrites-causes the real friends of freedom to doubt our sincerity, and especially because it forces so many really good men amongst ourselves into an open war with the very fundamental principles of civil liberty-criticizing the Declaration of Independence, and insisting that there is no right principle of action but _self-interest_.\n\n\"Before proceeding, let me say I think I have no prejudice against the Southern people. They are just what we would be in their situation. If slavery did not now exist among them, they would not introduce it. If it did now exist amongst us, we should not instantly give it up. This I believe of the masses North and South. Doubtless there are individuals on both sides, who would not hold slaves under any circumstances; and others who would gladly introduce slavery anew, if it were out of existence. We know that some Southern men do free their slaves, go North, and become tiptop Abolitionists; while some Northern ones go South, and become most cruel slave-masters.\n\n\"When Southern people tell us they are no more responsible for the origin of slavery than we, I acknowledge the fact. When it is said that the institution exists, and that it is very difficult to get rid of it, in any satisfactory way, I can understand and appreciate the saying. I surely will not blame them for not doing what I should not know how to do myself. If all earthly power were given me, I should not know what to do, as to the existing institution. My first impulse would be to free all the slaves, and send them to Liberia,-to their own native land. But a moment's reflection would convince me, that whatever of high hope, (as I think there is) there may be in this, in the long run, its sudden execution is impossible. If they were all landed there in a day, they would all perish in the next ten days; and there are not surplus shipping and surplus money enough in the world to carry them there in many times ten days. What then? Free them all, and keep them among us as underlings? Is it quite certain that this betters their condition? I think I would not hold one in slavery at any rate; yet the point is not clear enough to me to denounce people upon. What next? Free them, and make them politically and socially our equals? My own feelings will not admit of this; and if mine would, we well know that those of the great mass of white people will not. Whether this feeling accords with justice and sound judgment, is not the sole question, if, indeed, it is any part of it. A universal feeling, whether well or ill-founded, cannot be safely disregarded. We cannot, then, make them equals. It does seem to me that systems of gradual emancipation might be adopted; but for their tardiness in this, I will not undertake to judge our brethren of the South.\n\n\"When they remind us of their constitutional rights, I acknowledge them, not grudgingly, but fully and fairly; and I would give them any legislation for the reclaiming of their fugitives, which should not, in its stringency, be more likely to carry a free man into slavery, than our ordinary criminal laws are to hang an innocent one.\n\n\"But all this, to my judgment, furnishes no more excuse for permitting slavery to go into our own free territory, than it would for reviving the African slave-trade by law. The law which forbids the bringing of slaves _from_ Africa, and that which has so long forbid the taking of them _to_ Nebraska, can hardly be distinguished on any moral principle; and the repeal of the former could find quite as plausible excuses as that of the latter.\"\n\nI have reason to know that Judge Douglas _knows_ that I said this. I think he has the answer here to one of the questions he put to me. I do not mean to allow him to catechise me unless he pays back for it in kind. I will not answer questions one after another, unless he reciprocates; but as he has made this inquiry, and I have answered it before, he has got it without my getting anything in return. He has got my answer on the Fugitive Slave law.\n\nNow, gentlemen, I don't want to read at any greater length, but this is the true complexion of all I have ever said in regard to the institution of slavery and the black race. This is the whole of it, and anything that argues me into his idea of perfect social and political equality with the negro, is but a specious and fantastic arrangement of words, by which a man can prove a horse-chestnut to be a chestnut horse. [Laughter.] I will say here, while upon this subject, that I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so. I have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and the black races. There is a physical difference between the two, which, in my judgment, will probably forever forbid their living together upon the footing of perfect equality, and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity that there must be a difference, I, as well as Judge Douglas, am in favor of the race to which I belong having the superior position. I have never said anything to the contrary, but I hold that, notwithstanding all this, there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence, the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. [Loud cheers.] I hold that he is as much entitled to these as the white man. I agree with Judge Douglas he is not my equal in many respects-certainly not in color, perhaps not in moral or intellectual endowment. But in the right to eat the bread, without the leave of anybody else, which his own hand earns, _he is my equal and the equal of Judge Douglas, and the equal of every living man._ [Great applause.]\n\nNow I pass on to consider one or two more of these little follies. The Judge is wofully at fault about his early friend Lincoln being a \"grocery keeper.\" [Laughter.] I don't know as it would be a great sin, if I had been; but he is mistaken. Lincoln never kept a grocery anywhere in the world. [Laughter.] It is true that Lincoln did work the latter part of one winter in a little still house, up at the head of a hollow. [Roars of laughter.] And so I think my friend, the Judge, is equally at fault when he charges me at the time when I was in Congress of having opposed our soldiers who were fighting in the Mexican war. The Judge did not make his charge very distinctly, but I can tell you what he can prove, by referring to the record. You remember I was an old Whig, and whenever the Democratic party tried to get me to vote that the war had been righteously begun by the President, I would not do it. But whenever they asked for any money, or land-warrants, or anything to pay the soldiers there, during all that time, I gave the same vote that Judge Douglas did. [Loud applause.] You can think as you please as to whether that was consistent. Such is the truth; and the Judge has the right to make all he can out of it. But when he, by a general charge, conveys the idea that I withheld supplies from the soldiers who were fighting in the Mexican war, or did anything else to hinder the soldiers, he is, to say the least, grossly and altogether mistaken, as a consultation of the records will prove to him.\n\nAs I have not used up so much of my time as I had supposed, I will dwell a little longer upon one or two of these minor topics upon which the Judge has spoken. He has read from my speech in Springfield, in which I say that \"a house divided against itself cannot stand.\" Does the Judge say it _can_ stand? [Laughter.] I don't know whether he does or not. The Judge does not seem to be attending to me just now, but I would like to know if it is his opinion that a house divided against itself _can stand_. If he does, then there is a question of veracity, not between him and me, but between the Judge and an authority of a somewhat higher character. [Laughter and applause.]\n\nNow, my friends, I ask your attention to this matter for the purpose of saying something seriously. I know that the Judge may readily enough agree with me that the maxim which was put forth by the Saviour is true, but he may allege that I misapply it; and the Judge has a right to urge that, in my application, I do misapply it, and then I have a right to show that I do _not_ misapply it. When he undertakes to say that because I think this nation, so far as the question of slavery is concerned, will all become one thing or all the other, I am in favor of bringing about a dead uniformity in the various States, in all their institutions, he argues erroneously. The great variety of the local institutions in the States, springing from differences in the soil, differences in the face of the country, and in the climate, are bonds of Union. They do not make \"a house divided against itself,\" but they make a house united. If they produce in one section of the country what is called for by the wants of another section, and this other section can supply the wants of the first, they are not matters of discord but bonds of union, true bonds of union. But can this question of slavery be considered as among _these_ varieties in the institutions of the country? I leave it to you to say whether, in the history of our Government, this institution of slavery has not always failed to be a bond of union, and, on the contrary, been an apple of discord, and an element of division in the house. [Cries of \"Yes, yes,\" and applause.] I ask you to consider whether, so long as the moral constitution of men's minds shall continue to be the same, after this generation and assemblage shall sink into the grave, and another race shall arise, with the same moral and intellectual development we have-whether, if that institution is standing in the same irritating position in which it now is, it will not continue an element of division? [Cries of \"Yes, yes.\"] If so, then I have a right to say that, in regard to this question, the Union is a house divided against itself; and when the Judge reminds me that I have often said to him that the institution of slavery has existed for eighty years in some States, and yet it does not exist in some others, I agree to the fact, and I account for it by looking at the position in which our fathers originally placed it-restricting it from the new Territories where it had not gone, and legislating to cut off its source by the abrogation of the slave-trade thus putting the seal of legislation _against its spread_. The public mind _did_ rest in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction. [Cries of \"Yes, yes,\"] But lately, I think-and in this I charge nothing on the Judge's motives-lately, I think, that he, and those acting with him, have placed that institution on a new basis, which looks to the _perpetuity and nationalization of slavery_. [Loud cheers.] And while it is placed upon this new basis, I say, and I have said, that I believe we shall not have peace upon the question until the opponents of slavery arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction; or, on the other hand, that its advocates will push it forward until it shall become alike lawful in all the States, old as well as new, North as well as South. Now, I believe if we could arrest the spread, and place it where Washington, and Jefferson, and Madison placed it, it _would be_ in the course of ultimate extinction, and the public mind _would_, as for eighty years past, believe that it was in the course of ultimate extinction. The crisis would be past and the institution might be let alone for a hundred years, if it should live so long, in the States where it exists, yet it would be going out of existence in the way best for both the black and the white races. [Great cheering.]\n\nA VOICE- \"Then do you repudiate Popular Sovereignty?\"\n\nMR. LINCOLN-Well, then, let us talk about Popular Sovereignty! [Laughter.] What is Popular Sovereignty? [Cries of \"A humbug,\" \"a humbug.\"] Is it the right of the people to have Slavery or not have it, as they see fit, in the territories? I will state-and I have an able man to watch me-my understanding is that Popular Sovereignty, as now applied to the question of slavery, does allow the people of a Territory to have slavery if they want to, but does not allow them _not_ to have it if they _do not_ want it. [Applause and laughter.] I do not mean that if this vast concourse of people were in a Territory of the United States, any one of them would be obliged to have a slave if he did not want one; but I do say that, as I understand the Dred Scott decision, if any one man wants slaves, all the rest have no way of keeping that one man from holding them.\n\nWhen I made my speech at Springfield, of which the Judge complains, and from which he quotes, I really was not thinking of the things which he ascribes to me at all. I had no thought in the world that I was doing anything to bring about a war between the free and slave States. I had no thought in the world that I was doing anything to bring about a political and social equality of the black and white races. It never occurred to me that I was doing anything or favoring anything to reduce to a dead uniformity all the local institutions of the various States. But I must say, in all fairness to him, if he thinks I am doing something which leads to these bad results, it is none the better that I did not mean it. It is just as fatal to the country, if I have any influence in producing it, whether I intend it or not. But can it be true, that placing this institution upon the original basis-the basis upon which our fathers placed it-can have any tendency to set the Northern and the Southern States at war with one another, or that it can have any tendency to make the people of Vermont raise sugarcane, because they raise it in Louisiana, or that it can compel the people of Illinois to cut pine logs on the Grand Prairie, where they will not grow, because they cut pine logs in Maine, where they do grow? [Laughter.] The Judge says this is a new principle started in regard to this question. Does the Judge claim that he is working on the plan of the founders of Government? I think he says in some of his speeches-indeed, I have one here now-that he saw evidence of a policy to allow slavery to be south of a certain line, while north of it it should be excluded, and he saw an indisposition on the part of the country to stand upon that policy, and therefore he set about studying the subject upon _original principles_, and upon _original principles_ he got up the Nebraska bill! I am fighting it upon these _\"_ original principles''-fighting it in the Jeffersonian, Washingtonian, and Madisonian fashion. [Laughter and applause.]\n\nNow, my friends, I wish you to attend for a little while to one or two other things in that Springfield speech. My main object was to show, so far as my humble ability was capable of showing to the people of this country, what I believed was the truth-that there was a _tendency_, if not a conspiracy among those who have engineered this slavery question for the last four or five years, to make slavery perpetual and universal in this nation. Having made that speech principally for that object, after arranging the evidences that I thought tended to prove my proposition, I concluded with this bit of comment:\n\n\"We cannot absolutely know that these exact adaptations are the result of preconcert, but when we see a lot of framed timbers, different portions of which we know have been gotten out at different times and places, and by different workmen-Stephen, Franklin, Roger and James, for instance-and when we see these timbers joined together, and see they exactly make the frame of a house or a mill, all the tenons and mortices exactly fitting, and all the lengths and proportions of the different pieces exactly adapted to their respective places, and not a piece too many or too few -not omitting even the scaffolding-or if a single piece be lacking, we see the place in the frame exactly fitted and prepared yet to bring such piece in-in such a case we feel it impossible not to believe that Stephen and Franklin, and Roger and James, all understood one another from the beginning, and all worked upon a common plan or draft drawn before the first blow was struck.\" [Great cheers.]\n\nWhen my friend, Judge Douglas, came to Chicago, on the 9th of July, this speech having been delivered on the 16th of June, he made an harangue there, in which he took hold of this speech of mine, showing that he had carefully read it; and while he paid no attention to _this_ matter at all, but complimented me as being a \"kind, amiable and intelligent gentleman,\" notwithstanding I had said this, he goes on and eliminates, or draws out, from my speech this tendency of mine to set the States at war with one another, to make all the institutions uniform, and set the niggers and white people to marrying together. [Laughter.] Then, as the Judge had complimented me with these pleasant titles (I must confess to my weakness), I was a little \"taken,\" [laughter] for it came from a great man. I was not very much accustomed to flattery, and it came the sweeter to me. I was rather like the Hoosier, with the gingerbread, when he said he reckoned he loved it better than any other man, and got less of it. [Roars of laughter.] As the Judge had so flattered me, I could not make up my mind that he meant to deal unfairly with me; so I went to work to show him that he misunderstood the whole scope of my speech, and that I really never intended to set the people at war with one another. As an illustration, the next time I met him, which was at Springfield, I used this expression, that I claimed no right under the Constitution, nor had I any inclination, to enter into the Slave States and interfere with the institutions of slavery. He says upon that: Lincoln will not enter into the Slave States, but will go to the banks of the Ohio, on this side, and shoot over! [Laughter.] He runs on, step by step, in the horse-chestnut style of argument, until in the Springfield speech he says, \"Unless he shall be successful in firing his batteries, until he shall have extinguished slavery in all the States, the Union shall be dissolved.\" Now I don't think that was exactly the way to treat \"a kind, amiable, intelligent gentleman.\" I know if I had asked the Judge to show when or where it was I had said that, if I didn't succeed in firing into the slave States until slavery should be extinguished, the Union should be dissolved, he could not have shown it. I understand what he would do. He would say, \"I don't mean to quote from you, but this was the _result_ of what you say.\" But I have the right to ask, and I do ask now, Did you not put it in such a form that an ordinary reader or listener would take it as an expression _from me?_[Laughter.]\n\nIn a speech at Springfield, on the night of the 17th, I thought I might as well attend to my own business a little, and I recalled his attention as well as I could to this charge of conspiracy to nationalize slavery. I called his attention to the fact that he had acknowledged, in my hearing twice, that he had carefully read the speech, and, in the language of the lawyers, as he had twice read the speech, and still had put in no plea or answer, I took a default on him. I insisted that I had a right then to renew that charge of conspiracy. Ten days afterward I met the Judge at Clinton-that is to say, I was on the ground, but not in the discussion-and heard him make a speech. Then he comes in with his plea to this charge, for the first time, and his plea when put in, as well as I can recollect it, amounted to this: that he never had any talk with Judge Taney or the President of the United States with regard to the Dred Scott decision before it was made. I (Lincoln) ought to know that the man who makes a charge without knowing it to be true, falsifies as much as he who knowingly tells a falsehood; and lastly, that he would pronounce the whole thing a falsehood; but he would make no personal application of the charge of falsehood, not because of any regard for the \"kind, amiable, intelligent gentleman,\" but because of his own personal self-respect! [Roars of Laughter.] I have understood since then (but [turning to Judge Douglas] will not hold the Judge to it if he is not willing) that he has broken through the \"self-respect,\" and has got to saying the thing _out_. The Judge nods to me that it is so. [Laughter.] It is fortunate for me that I can keep as good-humored as I do, when the Judge acknowledges that he has been trying to make a question of veracity with me. I know the Judge is a great man, while I am only a small man, but _I feel that I have got him_. [Tremendous cheering.] I demur to that plea. I waive all objections that it was not filed till after default was taken, and demur to it upon the merits. What if Judge Douglas never did talk with Chief Justice Taney and the President, before the Dred Scott decision was made, does it follow that he could not have had as perfect an understanding without talking as with it? I am not disposed to stand upon my legal advantage. I am disposed to take his denial as being like an answer in chancery, that he neither had any knowledge, information or belief in the existence of such a conspiracy. I am disposed to take his answer as being as broad as though he had put it in these words. And now, I ask, even if he had done so, have not I a right to _prove it on him_, and to offer the evidence of more than two witnesses, by whom to prove it; and if the evidence proves the existence of the conspiracy, does his broad answer denying all knowledge, information, or belief, disturb the fact? It can only show that he was _used_ by conspirators, and was not a _leader_ of them. [Vociferous cheering.]\n\nNow, in regard to his reminding me of the moral rule that persons who tell what they do not know to be true, falsify as much as those who knowingly tell falsehoods. I remember the rule, and it must be borne in mind that in what I have read to you, I do not say that I _know_ such a conspiracy to exist. To that I reply, _I believe it_. If the Judge says that I do _not_ believe it, then _he_ says what _he_ does not know, and falls within his own rule, that he who asserts a thing which he does not know to be true, falsifies as much as he who knowingly tells a falsehood. I want to call your attention to a little discussion on that branch of the case, and the evidence which brought my mind to the conclusion which I expressed as my _belief_. If, in arraying that evidence, I had stated anything which was false or erroneous, it needed but that Judge Douglas should point it out, and I would have taken it back with all the kindness in the world. I do not deal in that way. If I have brought forward anything not a fact, if he will point it out, it will not even ruffle me to take it back. But if he will not point out anything erroneous in the evidence, is it not rather for him to show, by a comparison of the evidence, that I have _reasoned_ falsely, than to call the \"kind, amiable, intelligent gentleman\" a liar? [Cheers and laughter.] If I have reasoned to a false conclusion, it is the vocation of an able debater to show by argument that I have wandered to an erroneous conclusion. I want to ask your attention to a portion of the Nebraska bill, which Judge Douglas has quoted: \"It being the true intent and meaning of this act, not to legislate slavery into any Territory or State, nor to exclude it therefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the Constitution of the United States.\" Thereupon Judge Douglas and others began to argue in favor of \"Popular Sovereignty\" -the right of the people to have slaves if they wanted them, and to exclude slavery if they did not want them. \"But,\" said, in substance, a Senator from Ohio (Mr. Chase, I believe), \"we more than suspect that you do not mean to allow the people to exclude slavery if they wish to, and if you do mean it, accept an amendment which I propose expressly authorizing the people to exclude slavery.\" I believe I have the amendment here before me, which was offered, and under which the people of the Territory, through their proper representatives, might, if they saw fit, prohibit the existence of slavery therein. And now I state it as a _fact,_ to be taken back if there is any mistake about it, that Judge Douglas and those acting with him _voted that amendment down_. [Tremendous applause.] I now think that those men who voted it down, had a _real reason_ for doing so. They know what that reason was. It looks to us, since we have seen the Dred Scott decision pronounced, holding that, \"under the Constitution,\" the people cannot exclude slavery-I say it looks to outsiders, poor, simple, \"amiable, intelligent gentlemen,\" as though the niche was left as a place to put that Dred Scott decision in - [laughter and cheers] - a niche which would have been spoiled by adopting the amendment. And now, I say again, if _this_ was not the reason, it will avail the Judge much more to calmly and good-humoredly point out to these people what that _other_ reason was for voting the amendment down, than, swelling himself up, to vociferate that he may be provoked to call somebody a liar. [Tremendous applause.]\n\nAgain: there is in that same quotation from the Nebraska bill this clause- \"It being the true intent and meaning of this bill not to legislate slavery into any Territory or _State_.\" I have always been puzzled to know what business the word \"State\" had in that connection, Judge Douglas knows. _He put it there_. He knows what he put it there for. We outsiders cannot say what he put it there for. The law they were passing was not about States, and was not making provisions for States. What was it placed there for? After seeing the Dred Scott decision, which holds that the people cannot exclude slavery from a _Territory_, if another Dred Scott decision shall come, holding that they cannot exclude it from a _State_, we shall discover that when the word was originally put there, it was in view of something which was to come in due time, we shall see that it was the _other half_ of something. [Applause.] I now say again, if there is any different reason for putting it there, Judge Douglas, in a good humored way, without calling anybody a liar, _can tell what the reason was_. [Renewed cheers.]\n\nWhen the Judge spoke at Clinton, he came very near making a charge of falsehood against me. He used, as I found it printed in a newspaper, which, I remember, was very nearly like the real speech, the following language:\n\n\"I did not answer the charge [of conspiracy] before, for the reason that I did not suppose there was a man in America with a heart so corrupt as to believe such a charge could be true. I have too much respect for Mr. Lincoln to suppose he is serious in making the charge.\"\n\nI confess this is rather a curious view, that out of respect for me he should consider I was making what I deemed rather a grave charge in fun. [Laughter.] I confess it strikes me rather strangely. But I let it pass. As the Judge did not for a moment believe that there was a man in America whose heart was so \"corrupt\" as to make such a charge, and as he places me among the \"men in America\" who have hearts base enough to make such a charge, I hope he will excuse me if I hunt out another charge very like this; and if it should turn out that in hunting I should find that other, and it should turn out to be Judge Douglas himself who made it, I hope he will reconsider this question of the deep corruption of heart he has thought fit to ascribe to me. [Great applause and laughter.] In Judge Douglas's speech of March 22d, 1858, which I hold in my hand, he says:\n\n\"In this connection there is another topic to which I desire to allude. I seldom refer to the course of newspapers, or notice the articles which they publish in regard to myself; but the course of the Washington _Union_ has been so extraordinary, for the last two or three months, that I think it well enough to make some allusion to it. It has read me out of the Democratic party every other day, at least for two or three months, and keeps reading me out, (laughter;) and, as if it had not succeeded, still continues to read me out, using such terms as \"traitor,\" \"renegade,\" \"deserter,\" and other kind and polite epithets of that nature. Sir, I have no vindication to make of my Democracy against the Washington _Union_, or any other newspapers. I am willing to allow my history and action for the last twenty years to speak for themselves as to my political principles, and my fidelity to political obligations. The Washington _Union_ has a personal grievance. When its editor was nominated for public printer I declined to vote for him, and stated that at some time I might give my reasons for doing so. Since I declined to give that vote, this scurrilous abuse, these vindictive and constant attacks have been repeated almost daily on me. Will my friend from Michigan read the article to which I allude?\"\n\nThis is a part of the speech. You must excuse me from reading the entire article of the Washington _Union_, as Mr. Stuart read it for Mr. Douglas. The Judge goes on and sums up, as I think, correctly:\n\n\"Mr. President, you here find several distinct propositions advanced boldly by the Washington Union editorially, and apparently _authoritatively_, and any man who questions any of them is denounced as an Abolitionist, a Freesoiler, a fanatic. The propositions are, first, that the primary object of all government at its original institution is the protection of person and property; second, that the Constitution of the United States declares that the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States; and that, therefore, thirdly, all State laws, whether organic or otherwise, which prohibit the citizens of one State from settling in another with their slave property, and especially declaring it forfeited, are direct violations of the original intention of the Government and Constitution of the United States; and, fourth, that the emancipation of the slaves of the Northern States was a gross outrage on the rights of property, inasmuch as it was involuntarily done on the part of the owner.\n\n\"Remember that this article was published in the _Union_ on the 17th of November, and on the 18th appeared the first article giving the adhesion of the _Union_ to the Lecompton Constitution. It was in these words:\n\n\"KANSAS AND HER CONSTITUTION-The vexed question is settled. The problem is solved. The dead point of danger is passed. All serious trouble to Kansas affairs is over and gone'-\n\n\"And a column, nearly, of the same sort. Then, when you come to look into the Lecompton Constitution, you find the same doctrine incorporated in it which was put forth editorially in the _Union_. What is it?\n\n\" `ARTICLE 7, _Section 1_. The right of property is before and higher than any Constitutional sanction; and the right of the owner of a slave to such slave and its increase is the same and as inviolable as the right of the owner of any property whatever.'\n\n\"Then in the schedule is a provision that the Constitution may be amended after 1864 by a two-thirds vote.\n\n\"`But no alteration shall be made to affect the right of property in the ownership of slaves.'\n\n\"It will be seen by these clauses in the Lecompton Constitution, that they are identical in spirit with the _authoritative_ article in the Washington _Union_ of the day previous to its indorsement of this Constitution.\"\n\nI pass over some portions of the speech, and I hope that any one who feels interested in this matter will read the entire section of the speech, and see whether I do the Judge injustice. He proceeds: \"When I saw that article in the _Union_ of the 17th of November, followed by the glorification of the Lecompton Constitution on the 18th of November, and this clause in the Constitution asserting the doctrine that a State has no right to prohibit slavery within its limits, I saw that there was a _fatal blow_ being struck at the sovereignty of the States of this Union.\"\n\nI stop the quotation there, again requesting that it may all be read. I have read all of the portion I desire to comment upon. What is this charge that the Judge thinks I must have a very corrupt heart to make? It was a purpose on the part of certain high functionaries to make it impossible for the people of one State to prohibit the people of any other State from entering it with their \"property,\" so called, and making it a slave State. In other words, it was a charge implying a design to make the institution of slavery national. And now I ask your attention to what Judge Douglas has himself done here. I know he made that part of the speech as a reason why he had refused to vote for a certain man for public printer, but when we get at it, the charge itself is the very one I made against him, that he thinks I am so corrupt for uttering. Now, whom does he make that charge against? Does he make it against that newspaper editor merely? No; he says it is identical in spirit with the Lecompton Constitution, and so the framers of that Constitution are brought in with the editor of the newspaper in that \"fatal blow being struck.\" He did not call it a \"conspiracy.\" In his language it is a \"fatal blow being struck.\" And if the words carry the meaning better when changed from a \"conspiracy\" into a \"fatal blow being struck,\" I will change _my_ expression and call it \"fatal blow being struck.\" We see the charge made not merely against the editor of the _Union_, but all the framers of the Lecompton Constitution; and not only so, but the article was an _authoritative_ article. By whose authority? Is there any question but he means it was by the authority of the President and his Cabinet-the Administration?\n\nIs there any sort of question but he means to make that charge? Then there are the editors of the _Union_, the framers of the Lecompton Constitution, the President of the United States and his Cabinet, and all the supporters of the Lecompton Constitution, in Congress and out of Congress, who are all involved in this \"fatal blow being struck.\" I commend to Judge Douglas's consideration the question of _how corrupt a man's heart must be to make such a charge!_ [Vociferous cheering.]\n\nNow, my friends, I have but one branch of the subject, in the little time I have left, to which to call your attention, and as I shall come to a close at the end of that branch, it is probable that I shall not occupy quite all the time allotted to me. Although on these questions I would like to talk twice as long as I have, I could not enter upon another head and discuss it properly without running over my time. I ask the attention of the people here assembled and elsewhere, to the course that Judge Douglas is pursuing every day as bearing upon this question of making slavery national. Not going back to the records, but taking the speeches he makes, the speeches he made yesterday and day before, and makes constantly all over the country-I ask your attention to them. In the first place, what is necessary to make the institution national? Not war. There is no danger that the people of Kentucky will shoulder their muskets, and, with a young nigger stuck on every bayonet, march into Illinois and force them upon us. There is no danger of our going over there and making war upon them. Then what is necessary for the nationalization of slavery? It is simply the next Dred Scott decision. It is merely for the Supreme Court to decide that no _State_ under the Constitution can exclude it, just as they have already decided that under the Constitution neither Congress nor the Territorial Legislature can do it. When that is decided and acquiesced in, the whole thing is done. This being true, and this being the way, as I think, that slavery is to be made national, let us consider what Judge Douglas is doing every day to that end. In the first place, let us see what influence he is exerting on public sentiment. In this and like communities, public sentiment is everything. With public sentiment, nothing can fail; without it nothing can succeed. Consequently he who moulds public sentiment, goes deeper than he who enacts statutes or pronounces decisions. He makes statutes and decisions possible or impossible to be executed. This must be borne in mind, as also the additional fact that Judge Douglas is a man of vast influence, so great that it is enough for many men to profess to believe anything, when they once find out that Judge Douglas professes to believe it. Consider also the attitude he occupies at the head of a large party-a party which he claims has a majority of all the voters in the country. This man sticks to a decision which forbids the people of a Territory from excluding slavery, and he does so not because he says it is right in itself-he does not give any opinion on that-but because it has been _decided by the court_, and being decided by court, he is, and you are bound to take it in your political action as _law_-not that he judges at all of its merits, but because a decision of the court is to him a \"_Thus saith the Lord_.\" [Applause.] He places it on that ground alone, and you will bear in mind that, thus committing himself unreservedly to this decision, _commits him to the next one_ just as firmly as to this. He did not commit himself on account of the merit or demerit of the decision, but it is a _Thus saith the Lord_. The next decision, as much as this, will be a _Thus saith the Lord_. There is nothing that can divert or turn him away from this decision. It is nothing that I point out to him that his great prototype, Gen. Jackson, did not believe in the binding force of decisions. It is nothing to him that Jefferson did not so believe. I have said that I have often heard him approve of Jackson's course in disregarding the decision of the Supreme Court pronouncing a National Bank constitutional. He says, I did not hear him say so. He denies the accuracy of my recollection. I say he ought to know better than I, but I will make no question about this thing, though it still seems to me that I heard him say it twenty times. [Applause and laughter.] I will tell him though, that he now claims to stand on the Cincinnati platform, which affirms that Congress _cannot_ charter a National Bank, in the teeth of that old standing decision that Congress _can_ charter a bank. [Loud applause.] And I remind him of another piece of history on the question of respect for judicial decisions, and it is a piece of Illinois history, belonging to a time when the large party to which Judge Douglas belonged, were displeased with a decision of the Supreme Court of Illinois, because they had decided that a Governor could not remove a Secretary of State. You will find the whole story in Ford's History of Illinois, and I know that Judge Douglas will not deny that he was then in favor of overslaughing that decision by the mode of adding five new Judges, so as to vote down the four old ones. Not only so, but it ended in _the Judge's sitting down on that very bench as one of the five new Judges to break down the four old ones_. [Cheers and laughter.] It was in this way precisely that he got his title of Judge. Now, when the Judge tells me that men appointed conditionally to sit as members of a court, will have to be catechised beforehand upon some subject, I say, \"You know, Judge; you have tried it.\" [Laughter.] When he says a court of this kind will lose the confidence of all men, will be prostituted and disgraced by such a proceeding, I say, \"You know best, Judge; you have been through the mill.\" But I cannot shake Judge Douglas's teeth loose from the Dred Scott decision. Like some obstinate animal (I mean no disrespect), that will hang on when he has once got his teeth fixed; you may cut off a leg, or you may tear away an arm, still he will not relax his hold. And so I may point out to the Judge, and say that he is bespattered all over, from the beginning of his political life to the present time, with attacks upon judicial decisions-I may cut off limb after limb of his public record, and strive to wrench him from a single dictum of the court-yet I cannot divert him from it. He hangs, to the last, to the Dred Scott decision. [Loud cheers.] These things show there is a purpose _strong as death and eternity_ for which he adheres to this decision, and for which he will adhere to _all other decisions_ of the same court. [Vociferous applause.]\n\nA HIBERNIAN- \"Give us something besides Dred Scott.\"\n\nMR. LINCOLN-Yes; no doubt you want to hear something that don't hurt. [Laughter and applause.] Now, having spoken of the Dred Scott decision, one more word and I am done. Henry Clay, my beau ideal of a statesman, the man for whom I fought all my humble life-Henry Clay once said of a class of men who would repress all tendencies to liberty and ultimate emancipation, that they must, if they would do this, go back to the era of our Independence, and muzzle the cannon which thunders its annual joyous return; they must blow out the moral lights around us; they must penetrate the human soul, and eradicate there the love of liberty; and then, and not till then, could they perpetuate slavery in this country! [Loud cheers.] To my thinking, Judge Douglas is, by his example and vast influence, doing that very thing in this community, [cheers,] when he says that the negro has nothing in the Declaration of Independence. Henry Clay plainly understood the contrary. Judge Douglas is going back to the era of our Revolution, and to the extent of his ability, muzzling the cannon which thunders its annual joyous return. When he invites any people, willing to have slavery, to establish it, he is blowing out the moral lights around us. [Cheers.] When he says he \"cares not whether slavery is voted down or voted up''-that it is a sacred right of self-government-he is, in my judgment, penetrating the human soul and eradicating the light of reason and the love of liberty in this American people. [Enthusiastic and continued applause.] And now I will only say that when, by all these means and appliances, Judge Douglas shall succeed in bringing public sentiment to an exact accordance with his own views-when these vast assemblages shall echo back all these sentiments-when they shall come to repeat his views and to avow his principles, and to say all that he says on these mighty questions-then it needs only the formality of the second Dred Scott decision, which he indorses in advance, to make slavery alike lawful in all the States-old as well as new, North as well as South.\n\nMy friends, that ends the chapter. The Judge can take his half hour.\n\n**Mr. Douglas' Reply**\n\nFellow citizens: I will now occupy the half hour allotted to me in replying to Mr. Lincoln. The first point to which I will call your attention is, as to what I said about the organization of the Republican party in 1854, and the platform that was formed on the 5th of October, of that year, and I will then put the question to Mr. Lincoln, whether or not, he approves of each article in that platform (\"he answered that already\"), and ask for a specific answer. (\"He has answered.\" \"You cannot make him answer,\" &c.) I did not charge him with being a member of the committee which reported that platform. (\"Yes, you did.\") I charged that that platform was the platform of the Republican party adopted by them. The fact that it was the platform of the Republican party is not denied, but Mr. Lincoln now says, that although his name was on the committee which reported it, that he does not think he was there, but thinks he was in Tazewell, holding court. (\"He said he was there.\") Gentlemen, I ask your silence, and no interruption. Now, I want to remind Mr. Lincoln that he was at Springfield when that Convention was held and those resolutions adopted. (\"You can't do it.\" \"He wasn't there,\" &c.)\n\n[MR. GLOVER, chairman of the Republican committee - I hope no Republican will interrupt Mr. Douglas. The masses listened to Mr. Lincoln attentively, and as respectable men we ought now to hear Mr. Douglas, and without interruption.] (\"Good.\")\n\nMR. DOUGLAS, resuming - The point I am going to remind Mr. Lincoln of is this: that after I had made my speech in 1854, during the fair, he gave me notice that he was going to reply to me the next day. I was sick at the time, but I staid over in Springfield to hear his reply and to reply to him. On that day this very Convention, the resolutions adopted by which I have read, was to meet in the Senate chamber. He spoke in the hall of the House; and when he got through his speech-my recollection is distinct, and I shall never forget it-Mr. Codding walked in as I took the stand to reply, and gave notice that the Republican State Convention would meet instantly in the Senate chamber, and called upon the Republicans to retire there and go into this very Convention, instead of remaining and listening to me. (Three cheers for Douglas.)\n\nMR. LINCOLN, interrupting, excitedly and angrily - Judge, add that I went along with them. (This interruption was made in a pitifulm, mean, sneaking way, as Lincoln floundered around the stand.)\n\nMR. DOUGLAS-Gentlemen, Mr. Lincoln tells me to add that he went along with them to the Senate chamber. I will not add that, because I do not know whether he did or not.\n\nMR. LINCOLN, again interrupting - I know he did not.\n\n[Two of the Republican committee here seized Mr. Lincoln and by a sudden jerk caused him to disappear from the front of the stand, one of them saying quite audibly, \"What are you making such a fuss for. Douglas didn't interrupt you, and can't you see that the people don't like it.\"]\n\nMR. DOUGLAS-I do not know whether he knows it or not, that is not the point, and I will yet bring him on to the question.\n\nIn the first place - Mr. Lincoln was selected by the very men who made the Republican organization, on that day, to reply to me. He spoke for them and for that party, and he was the leader of the party; and on the very day he made his speech in reply to me, preaching up this same doctrine of negro equality, under the Declaration of Independence, this Republican party met in Convention. (Three cheers for Douglas.) Another evidence that he was acting in concert with them is to be found in the fact that that Convention waited an hour after its time of meeting to hear Lincoln's speech, and Codding one of their leading men, marched in the moment Lincoln got through, and gave notice that they did not want to hear me, and would proceed with the business of the Convention. Still another fact. I have here a newspaper printed at Springfield, Mr. Lincoln's own town, in October, 1854, a few days afterward, publishing these resolutions, charging Mr. Lincoln with entertaining these sentiments, and trying to prove that they were also the sentiments of Mr. Yates, then candidate for Congress. This has been published on Mr. Lincoln over and over again, and never before has he denied it. (Three cheers.)\n\nBut, my friends, this denial of his that he did not act on the committee, is a miserable quibble to avoid the main issue, (applause.) (\"That's so,\") which is, that this Republican platform declares in favor of the unconditional repeal of the Fugitive Slave law. Has Lincoln answered whether he indorsed that or not? (No, no.) I called his attention to it when I first addressed you, and asked him for an answer, and I then predicted that he would not answer. (Bravo, glourious, and cheers.) How does he answer. Why, that he was not on the committee that wrote the resolutions. (Laughter.) I then repeated the next proposition contained in the resolutions, which was to restrict slavery in those States in which it exists, and asked him whether he indorsed it. Does he answer yes, or no? He says in reply, \"I was not on the committee at the time; I was up in Tazewell.\" The next question I put to him was, whether he was in favor of prohibiting the admission of any more slave States into the Union. I put the question to him distinctly, whether, if the people of the Territory, when they had sufficient population to make a State, should form their Constitution recognizing slavery, he would vote for or against its admission. (\"That's it.\") He is a candidate for the United States Senate, and it is possible, if he should be elected, that he would have to vote directly on that question. (\"He never will.\") I asked him to answer me and you, whether he would vote to admit a State into the Union, with slavery or without it, as its own people might choose. (\"Hear him,\" \"That's the docntrine,\" and applause.) He did not answer that question. (\"He never will.\") He dodges that question also, under the cover that he was not on the Committee at the time, that he was not present when the platform was made. I want to know if he should happen to be in the Senate when a State applied for admission, with a Constitution acceptable to her own people, he would vote to admit that State, if slavery was one of its institutions. (That's the question.) He avoids the answer.\n\nMR. LINCOLN-interrupting a third time excitedly, No, Judge - (Mr. Lincoln again disappeared suddenly aided by a pull from behind.)\n\nMR. DOUGLAS. It is true he gives the Abolitionists to understand by a hint that he would not vote to admit such a State. And why? He goes on to say that the man who would talk about giving each State the right to have slavery, or not, as it pleased, was akin to the man who would muzzle the guns which thundered forth the annual joyous return of the day of our independence. (Great laughter.) He says that that kind of talk is casting a blight on the glory of this country. What is the meaning of that? That he is not in favor of each State to have the right of doing as it pleases on the slavery question? (\"Stick it to him,\" \"don't spare him,\" and applause.) I will put the question to him again and again, and I intend to force it out of him. (Immense applause.)\n\nThen again, this platform which was made at Springfield by his own party, when he was its acknowledged head, provides that Republicans will insist on the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia, and I asked Lincoln specifically whether he agreed with them in that? Did you get an answer? (\"No, no.\") He is afraid to answer it. (\"We will not vote for him.\") He knows I will trot him down to Egypt. (Laughter and cheers.) I intend to make him answer there, (\"that's right,\") or I will show the people of Illinois that he does not intend to answer these questions. (\"Keep him to the point,\" \"give us more,\" etc.) The convention to which I have been alluding goes a little further, and pledges itself to exclude slavery from all the Territories over which the General Government has exclusive jurisdiction north of 36 deg. 30 min., as well as South. Now I want to know whether he approves that provision. (He'll never answer and cheers.) I want him to answer, and when he does, I want to know his opinion on another point, which is, whether he will redeem the pledge of this platform and resist the acquirement of any more territory unless slavery therein shall be forever prohibited. I want him to answer this last question. Each of the questions I have put to him are practical questions-questions based upon the fundamental principles of the Black Republican party, and I want to know whether he is the first, last, and only choice of a party with whom he does not agree in principle. (\"Great applause,\") (\"Rake him down.\") He does not deny but that that principle was unanimously adopted by the Republican party; he does not deny that the whole Republican party is pledged to it; he does not deny that a man who is not faithful to it is faithless to the Republican party; and now I want to know whether that party is unanimously in favor of a man who does not adopt that creed and agree with them in their principles: I want to know whether the man who does not agree with them, and who is afraid to avow his differences, and who dodges the issue, is the first, last, and only choice of the Republican party. (Cheers.) A VOICE, how about this conspiracy?\n\nMR. DOUGLAS, never mind, I will come to that soon enough. (Bravo, Judge, hurra, three cheers for Douglas.) But the platform which I have read to you not only lays down these principles, but it adds:\n\n_Resolved_, That in furtherance of these principles we will use such constitutional and lawful means as shall seem best adapted to their accomplishment, and that we will support no man for office, under the general or state government, who is not positively and fully committed to the support of these principles, and whose personal character and conduct is not a guaranty that he is reliable, and who shall not have abjured old party allegiance and ties.\n\n(\"Good,\" \"you have him,\" &c.)\n\nThe Black Republican party stands pledged that they will never support Lincoln until he has pledged himself to that platform, (tremendous applause, men throwing up their hats, and shouting, \"you've got him,\") but he cannot devise his answer; he has not made up his mind whether he will or not. (Great laughter.) He talked about everything else he could think of to occupy his hour and a half, and when he could not think of anything more to say, without an excuse for refusing to answer these questions, he sat down long before his time was out. (Cheers.)\n\nIn relation to Mr. Lincoln's charge of conspiracy against me, I have a word to say. In his speech today he quotes a playful part of his speech at Springfield, about Stephen, and James, and Franklin, and Roger, and says that I did not take exception to it. I did not answer it, and he repeats it again. I did not take exception to this figure of his. He has a right to be as playful as he pleases in throwing his arguments together, and I will not object; but I did take objection to his second Springfield speech, in which he stated that he intended his first speech as a charge of corruption or conspiracy against the Supreme Court of the United States, President Pierce, President Buchanan, and myself. That gave the offensive character to the charge. He then said that when he made it he did not know whether it was true or not (laughter), but inasmuch as Judge Douglas had not denied it, although he had replied to the other parts of his speech three times, he repeated it as a charge of conspiracy against me, thus charging me with moral turpitude. When he put it in that form I did say that inasmuch as he repeated the charge simply because I had not denied it, I would deprive him of the opportunity of ever repeating it again, by declaring that it was in all its bearings an infamous lie. (Three cheers for Douglas.) He says he will repeat it until I answer his folly and nonsense, about Stephen, and Franklin, and Roger, and Bob, and James.\n\nHe studied that out, prepared that one sentence with the greatest care, committed it to memory, and put it in his first Springfield speech, and now he carries that speech around and reads that sentence to show how pretty it is. (Laughter.) His vanity is wounded because I will not go into that beautiful figure of his about the building of a house. (Renewed laughter.) All I have to say is, that I am not green enough to let him make a charge which he acknowledges he does not know to be true, and then take up my time in answering it, when I know it to be false and nobody else knows it to be true. (Cheers.)\n\nI have not brought a charge of moral turpitude against him. When he, or any other man, brings one against me, instead of disproving it I will say that it is a lie, and let him prove it if he can. (Enthusiastic applause.)\n\nI have lived twenty-five years in Illinois. I have served you with all the fidelity and ability which I possess, (\"That's so,\" \"good.\" and cheers,) and Mr. Lincoln is at liberty to attack my public action, my votes, and my conduct; but when he dares to attack my moral integrity, by a charge of conspiracy between myself, Chief Justice Taney and the Supreme Court, and two Presidents of the United States, I will repel it. (\"Three cheers for Douglas.\")\n\nMr. Lincoln has not character enough for integrity and truth, merely on his own _ipse dixit_ to arraign President Buchanan, President Pierce, and nine judges of the Supreme Court, not one of whom would be complimented by being put on an equality with him. (\"Hit him again, three cheers\" &c.) There is an unpardonable presumption in a man putting himself up before thousands of people, and pretending that his _ipse dixit_, without proof, without fact and without truth, is enough to bring down and destroy the purest and best of living men. (\"Hear him,\" \"Three cheers.\")\n\nFellow-citizens, my time is fast expiring; I must pass on. Mr. Lincoln wants to know why I voted against Mr. Chase's amendment to the Nebraska bill. I will tell him. In the first place, the bill already conferred all the power which Congress had, by giving the people the whole power over the subject. Chase offered a proviso that they might abolish slavery, which by implication would convey the idea that they could prohibit by not introducing that institution. Gen. Cass asked him to modify his amendment, so as to provide that the people might either prohibit or introduce slavery, and thus make it fair and equal. Chase refused to so modify his proviso, and then Gen. Cass and all the rest of us, voted it down. (Immense cheering.) These facts appear on the journals and debates of Congress, where Mr. Lincoln found the charge, and if he had told the whole truth, there would have been no necessity for me to occupy your time in explaining the matter.\n\nMr. Lincoln wants to know why the word \"state,\" as well as \"territory,\" was put into the Nebraska Bill! I will tell him. It was put there to meet just such false arguments as he has been adducing. (Laughter.) That first, not only the people of the Territories should do as they pleased, but that when they come to be admitted as States, they should come into the Union with or without slavery, as the people determined. I meant to knock in the head this Abolition doctrine of Mr. Lincoln's, that there shall be no more slave States, even if the people want them. (Tremendous applause.) And it does not do for him to say, or for any other Black Republican to say, that there is nobody in favor of the doctrine of no more slave States, and that nobody wants to interfere with the right of the people to do as they please. What was the origin of the Missouri difficulty and the Missouri compromise? The people of Missouri formed a constitution as a slave State, and asked admission into the Union, but the Free Soil party of the North being in a majority, refused to admit her because she had slavery as one of her institutions. Hence this first slavery agitation arose upon a State and not upon a Territory, and yet Mr. Lincoln does not know why the word State was placed in the Kansas-Nebraska bill. (Great laughter and applause.) The whole Abolition agitation arose on that doctrine of prohibiting a State from coming in with Slavery or not, as it pleased, and that same doctrine is here in this Republican platform of 1854; it has never been repealed; and every Black Republican stands pledged by that platform, never to vote for any man who is not in favor of it. Yet Mr. Lincoln does not know that there is a man in the world who is in favor of preventing a State from coming in as it pleases, notwithstanding. The Springfield platform says that they, the Republican party, will not allow a State to come in under such circumstances. He is an ignorant man. (Cheers.)\n\nNow you see that upon these very points I am as far from bringing Mr. Lincoln up to the line as I ever was before. He does not want to avow his principles. I do want to avow mine, as clear as sunlight in mid-day. (Cheers and applause.) Democracy is founded upon the eternal principle of right. (That is the talk.) The plainer these principles are avowed before the people, the stronger will be the support which they will receive. I only wish I had the power to make them so clear that they would shine in the heavens for every man, woman, and child to read. (Loud cheering.) The first of those principles that I would proclaim would be in opposition to Mr. Lincoln's doctrine of uniformity between the different States, and I would declare instead the sovereign right of each State to decide the slavery question as well as all other domestic questions for themselves, without interference from any other State or power whatsoever. (Hurrah for Douglas.)\n\nWhen that principle is recognized, you will have peace and harmony and fraternal feeling between all the States of this Union; until you do recognize that doctrine, there will be sectional warfare agitating and distracting the country. What does Mr. Lincoln propose? He says that the Union cannot exist divided into free and slave States. If it cannot endure thus divided, then he must strive to make them all free or all slave, which will inevitably bring about a dissolution of the Union. (Cries of \"he can't do it.\")\n\nGentlemen, I am told that my time is out, and I am obliged to stop. (Three times three cheers were here given for Senator Douglas.)\n\n[Second Debate](https://www.nps.gov/liho/historyculture/debate2.htm)\n\n[Back to Debates](https://www.nps.gov/liho/historyculture/debates.htm)\n\n[Back to History and Culture](https://www.nps.gov/liho/historyculture/index.htm)"

Estimates as high as 15,000 were reported in various newspaper accounts.\n\nLincoln answered the seven questions Douglas posed at Ottawa and then asked four of his own. Douglas' response became known as the Freeport Doctrine which had ramifications at the 1860 Democratic National Convention.\n\nSource: Neely, Mark E. Jr. 1982. _The Abraham Lincoln Encyclopedia_. New York: Da Capo Press, Inc.\n\nFull text of the debate follows.\n\n**Mr. Lincoln's Speech**\n\nMr. Lincoln was introduced by Hon. Thomas J. Turner, and was greeted with loud cheers. When the applause had subsided, he said:\n\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN - On Saturday last, Judge Douglas and myself first met in public discussion. He spoke one hour, I an hour and a half, and he replied for half an hour. The order is now reversed. I am to speak an hour, he an hour and a half, and then I am to reply for half an hour. I propose to devote myself during the first hour to the scope of what was brought within the range of his half-hour speech at Ottawa. Of course there was brought within the scope in that half-hour's speech something of his own opening speech. In the course of that opening argument Judge Douglas proposed to me seven distinct interrogatories. In my speech of an hour and a half, I attended to some other parts of his speech, and incidentally, as I thought, answered one of the interrogatories then. I then distinctly intimated to him that I would answer the rest of his interrogatories on condition only that he should agree to answer as many for me. He made no intimation at the time of the proposition, nor did he in his reply allude at all to that suggestion of mine. I do him no injustice in saying that he occupied at least half of his reply in dealing with me as though I had _refused_ to answer his interrogatories. I now propose that I will answer any of the interrogatories, upon condition that he will answer quest ions from me not exceeding the same number. I give him an opportunity to respond. The Judge remains silent. I now say that I will answer his interrogatories, whether he answers mine or not; [applause] and that after I have done so, I shall propound mine to him. [Applause.]\n\n[Owing to the press of people against the platform, our reporter did not reach the stand until Mr. Lincoln had spoken to this point. The previous remakrs were taken by a gentleman in Freeport, who has politely furnished them to us.]\n\nI have supposed myself, since the organization of the Republican party at Bloomington, in May, 1856, bound as a party man by the platforms of the party, then and since. If in any interrogatories which I shall answer I go beyond the scope of what is within these platforms, it will be perceived that no one is responsible but myself.\n\nHaving said thus much, I will take up the Judge's interrogatories as I find them printed in the Chicago _Times_, and answer them _seriatim_. In order that there may be no mistake about it, I have copied the interrogatories in writing, and also my answers to them. The first one of these interrogatories is in these words:\n\nQuestion 1. \"I desire to know whether Lincoln to-day stands, as he did in 1854, in favor of the unconditional repeal of the Fugitive Slave law?\"\n\nAnswer. I do not now, nor ever did, stand in favor of the unconditional repeal of the Fugitive Slave law. [Cries of \"Good,\" \"Good.\"]\n\nQ. 2. \"I desire him to answer whether he stands pledged to-day, as he did in 1854, against the admission of any more slave States into the Union, even if the people want them?\"\n\nA. I do not now, or ever did, stand pledged against the admission of any more slave States into the Union.\n\nQ. 3. \"1 want to know whether he stands pledged against the admission of a new State into the Union with such a Constitution as the people of that State may see fit to make?\"\n\nA. I do not stand pledged against the admission of a new State into the Union, with such a Constitution as the people of that State may see fit to make. [Cries of \"good,\" \"good.\"]\n\nQ. 4. \"I want to know whether he stands to-day pledged to the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia?\"\n\nA. I do not stand to-day pledged to the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia.\n\nQ. 5. \"I desire him to answer whether he stands pledged to the prohibition of the slave-trade between the different States?\"\n\nA. I do not stand pledged to the prohibition of the slave-trade between the different States.\n\nQ. 6. \"I desire to know whether he stands pledged to prohibit slavery in all the Territories of the United States, North as well as South of the Missouri Compromise line?\"\n\nA. I am impliedly, if not expressly, pledged to a belief in the _right_ and _duty_ of Congress to prohibit slavery in all the United States Territories.\n\nQ. 7. \"I desire him to answer whether he is opposed to the acquisition of any new territory unless slavery is first prohibited therein?\"\n\nA. I am not generally opposed to honest acquisition of territory; and, in any given case, I would or would not oppose such acquisition, accordingly as I might think such acquisition would or would not agravate [sic] the slavery question among ourselves. [Cries of good, good.]\n\nNow, my friends, it will be perceived upon an examination of these questions and answers, that so far I have only answered that I was not _pledged_ to this, that or the other. The Judge has not framed his interrogatories to ask me anything more than this, and I have answered in strict accordance with the interrogatories, and have answered truly that I am not _pledged_ at all upon any of the points to which I have answered. But I am not disposed to hang upon the exact form of his interrogatory. I am rather disposed to take up at least some of these questions, and state what I really think upon them.\n\nAs to the first one, in regard to the Fugitive Slave law, I have never hesitated to say, and I do not now hesitate to say, that I think, under the Constitution of the United States, the people of the Southern States are entitled to a Congressional Fugitive Slave law. Having said that, I have had nothing to say in regard to the existing Fugitive Slave law, further than that I think it should have been framed so as to be free from some of the objections that pertain to it, without lessening its efficiency. And inasmuch as we are not now in an agitation in regard to an alteration or modification of that law, I would not be the man to introduce it as a new subject of agitation upon the general question of slavery.\n\nIn regard to the other question, of whether I am pledged to the admission of any more slave States into the Union, I state to you very frankly that I would be exceedingly sorry ever to be put in a position of having to pass upon that question. I should be exceedingly glad to know that there would never be another slave State admitted into the Union; but I must add, that if slavery shall be kept out of the Territories during the territorial existence of any one given Territory, and then the people shall, having a fair chance and a clear field, when they come to adopt the Constitution, do such an extraordinary thing as to adopt a slave Constitution, uninfluenced by the actual presence of the institution among them, I see no alternative, if we own the country, but to admit them into the Union. [Applause.]\n\nThe third interrogatory is answered by the answer to the second, it being, as I conceive, the same as the second.\n\nThe fourth one is in regard to the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia. In relation to that, I have my mind very distinctly made up. I should be exceedingly glad to see slavery abolished in the District of Columbia. [Cries of \"good, good.\"] I believe that Congress possesses the constitutional power to abolish it. Yet as a member of Congress, I should not with my present views, be in favor of _endeavoring_ to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, unless it would be upon these conditions: _First_, that the abolition should be gradual. _Second_, that it should be on a vote of the majority of qualified voters in the District; and _third_, that compensation should be made to unwilling owners. With these three conditions, I confess I would be exceedingly glad to see Congress abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, and, in the language of Henry Clay, \"sweep from our Capital that foul blot upon our nation.\" [Loud applause.]\n\nIn regard to the fifth interrogatory, I must say here, that as to the question of the abolition of the slave-trade between the different States, I can truly answer, as I have, that I am _pledged_ to nothing about it. It is a subject to which I have not given that mature consideration that would make me feel authorized to state a position so as to hold myself entirely bound by it. In other words, that question has never been prominently enough before me to induce me to investigate whether we really have the constitutional power to do it. I could investigate it if I had sufficient time, to bring myself to a conclusion upon that subject; but I have not done so, and I say so frankly to you here, and to Judge Douglas. I must say, however, that if I should be of opinion that Congress does possess the constitutional power to abolish the slave-trade among the different States, I should still not be in favor of the exercise of that power unless upon some conservative principle as I conceive it, akin to what I have said in relation to the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia.\n\nMy answer as to whether I desire that slavery should be prohibited in all the Territories of the United States, is full and explicit within itself, and cannot be made clearer by any comments of mine. So I suppose in regard to the question whether I am opposed to the acquisition of any more territory unless slavery is first prohibited therein, my answer is such that I could add nothing by way of illustration, or making myself better understood, than the answer which I have placed in writing.\n\nNow in all this, the Judge has me, and he has me on the record. I suppose he had flattered himself that I was really entertaining one set of opinions for one place and another set for another place -that I was afraid to say at one place what I uttered at another. What I am saying here I suppose I say to a vast audience as strongly tending to Abolitionism as any audience in the State of Illinois, and I believe I am saying that which, if it would be offensive to any persons and render them enemies to myself, would be offensive to persons in this audience.\n\nI now proceed to propound to the Judge the interrogatories, so far as I have framed them. I will bring forward a new installment when I get them ready. [Laughter.] I will bring them forward now, only reaching to number four.\n\nThe first one is:\n\nQuestion 1. If the people of Kansas shall, by means entirely unobjectionable in all other respects, adopt a State Constitution, and ask admission into the Union under it, _before_ they have the requisite number of inhabitants according to the English bill-some ninety-three thousand-will you vote to admit them? [Applause.]\n\nQ. 2. Can the people of a United States Territory, in any lawful way, against the wish of any citizen of the United States, exclude slavery from its limits prior to the formation of a State Constitution? [Renewed applause.]\n\nQ. 3. If the Supreme Court of the United States shall decide that States cannot exclude slavery from their limits, are you in favor of acquiescing in, adopting and following such decision as a rule of political action? [Loud applause.]\n\nQ. 4. Are you in favor of acquiring additional territory, in disregard of how such acquisition may affect the nation on the slavery question? [Cries of \"good,\" \"good.\"]\n\nAs introductory to these interrogatories which Judge Douglas propounded to me at Ottawa, he read a set of resolutions which he said Judge Trumbull and myself had participated in adopting, in the first Republican State Convention, held at Springfield, in October, 1854. He insisted that I and Judge Trumbull, and perhaps the entire Republican party, were responsible for the doctrines contained in the set of resolutions which he read, and I understand that it was from that set of resolutions that he deduced the interrogatories which he propounded to me, using these resolutions as a sort of authority for propounding those questions to me. Now I say here today that I do not answer his interrogatories because of their springing at all from that set of resolutions which he read. I answered them because Judge Douglas thought fit to ask them. [Applause.] I do not now, nor never did, recognize any responsibility upon myself in that set of resolutions. When I replied to him on that occasion, I assured him that I never had anything to do with them. I repeat here to-day, that I never in any possible form had anything to do with that set of resolutions. It turns out, I believe, that those resolutions were never passed in any Convention held in Springfield. [Cheers and Laughter.] It turns out that they were never passed at any Convention or any public meeting that I had any part in. I believe it turns out in addition to all this, that there was not, in the fall of 1854, any Convention holding a session in Springfield, calling itself a Republican State Convention; yet it is true there was a Convention, or assemblage of men calling themselves a Convention, at Springfield, that did pass _some_ resolutions. But so little did I really know of the proceedings of that Convention, or what set of resolutions they had passed, though having a general knowledge that there had been such an assemblage of men there, that when Judge Douglas read the resolutions, I really did not know but they had been the resolutions passed then and there. I did not question that they were the resolutions adopted. For I could not bring myself to suppose that Judge Douglas could say what he did upon this subject without _knowing_ that it was true. [Cheers and laughter.] I contented myself, on that occasion, with denying, as I truly could, all connection with them, not denying or affirming whether they were passed at Springfield. Now it turns out that he had got hold of some resolutions passed at some Convention or public meeting in Kane county. [Renewed laughter.] I wish to say here, that I don't conceive that in any fair and just mind this discovery relieves me at all. I had just as much to do with the Convention in Kane county as that at Springfield. I am just as much responsible for the resolutions at Kane county as those at Springfield, the amount of the responsibility being exactly nothing in either case; no more than there would be in regard to a set of resolutions passed in the moon. [Laughter and loud cheers.]\n\nI allude to this extraordinary matter in this canvass for some further purpose than anything yet advanced. Judge Douglas did not make his statement upon that occasion as matters that he believed to be true, but he stated them roundly as _being true_, in such form as to pledge his veracity for their truth. When the whole matter turns out as it does, and when we consider who Judge Douglas is-that he is a distinguished Senator of the United States-that he has served nearly twelve years as such-that his character is not at all limited as an ordinary Senator of the United States, but that his name has become of world-wide renown-it is _most extraordinary_ that he should so far forget all the suggestions of justice to an adversary, or of prudence to himself, as to venture upon the assertion of that which the slightest investigation would have shown him to be wholly false. [Cheers.] I can only account for his having done so upon the supposition that that evil genius which has attended him through his life, giving to him an apparent astonishing prosperity, such as to lead very many good men to doubt there being any advantage in virtue over vice - [Cheers and laughter] I say I can only account for it on the supposition that that evil genius has at last made up its mind to forsake him. [Continued cheers and laughter.]\n\nAnd I may add that another extraordinary feature of the Judge's conduct in this canvass-made more extraordinary by this incident-is, that he is in the habit, in almost all the speeches he makes, of charging falsehood upon his adversaries, myself and others. I now ask whether he is able to find in any thing that Judge Trumbull, for instance, has said, or in any thing that I have said, a justification at all compared with what we have, in this instance, for that sort of vulgarity. [Cries of \"good,\" \"good,\" \"good.\"]\n\nI have been in the habit of charging as a matter of belief on my part, that, in the introduction of the Nebraska bill into Congress, there was a conspiracy to make slavery perpetual and national. I have arranged from time to time the evidence which establishes and proves the truth of this charge. I recurred to this charge at Ottawa. I shall not now have time to dwell upon it at very great length; but, inasmuch as Judge Douglas in his reply of half an hour, made some points upon me in relation to it, I propose noticing a few of them.\n\nThe Judge insists that, in the first speech I made, in which I very distinctly made that charge, he thought for a good while I was in fun!-that I was playful-that I was not sincere about it-and that he only grew angry and somewhat excited when he found that I insisted upon it as a matter of earnestness. He says he characterized it as a falsehood as far as I implicated his _moral character_ in that transaction. Well, I did not know, till he presented that view, that I had implicated his moral character. He is very much in the habit, when he argues me up into a position I never thought of occupying, of very cosily saying he has no doubt Lincoln is \"conscientious\" in saying so. He should remember that I did not know but what _he_ was ALTOGETHER \"CONSCIENTIOUS\" in that matter. [Great Laughter.] I can conceive it possible for men to conspire to do a good thing, and I really find nothing in Judge Douglas's course or arguments that is contrary to or inconsistent with his belief of a conspiracy to nationalize and spread slavery as being a good and blessed thing, [Continued Laughter,] and so I hope he will understand that I do not at all question but that in all this matter he is entirely \"conscientious.\" [More laughter and cheers.]\n\nBut to draw your attention to one of the points I made in this case, beginning at the beginning. When the Nebraska bill was introduced, or a short time afterward, by an amendment, I believe, it was provided that it must be considered \"the true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any State or Territory, or to exclude it therefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their own domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the Constitution of the United States.\" I have called his attention to the fact that when he and some others began arguing that they were giving an increased degree of liberty to the people in the Territories over and above what they formerly had on the question of slavery, a question was raised whether the law was enacted to give such unconditional liberty to the people, and to test the sincerity of this mode of argument, Mr. Chase, of Ohio, introduced an amendment, in which he made the law-if the amendment were adopted -expressly declare that the people of the Territory should have the power to exclude slavery if they saw fit. I have asked attention also to the fact that Judge Douglas and those who acted with him, voted that amendment down, notwithstanding it expressed exactly the thing they said was the true intent and meaning of the law. I have called attention to the fact that in subsequent times, a decision of the Supreme Court has been made, in which it has been declared that a Territorial Legislature has no constitutional right to exclude slavery. And I have argued and said that for men who did intend that the people of the Territory should have the right to exclude slavery absolutely and unconditionally, the voting down of Chase's amendment is wholly inexplicable. It is a puzzle-a riddle. But I have said that with men who did look forward to such a decision, or who had it in contemplation, that such a decision of the Supreme Court would or might be made, the voting down of that amendment would be perfectly rational and intelligible. It would keep Congress from coming in collision with the decision when it was made. Any body can conceive that if there was an intention or expectation that such a decision was to follow, it would not be a very desirable party attitude to get into for the Supreme Court-all or nearly all its members belonging to the same party-to decide one way, when the party in Congress had decided the other way. Hence it would be very rational for men expecting such a decision, to keep the niche in that law clear for it. After pointing this out, I tell Judge Douglas that it looks to me as though here was the reason why Chase's amendment was voted down. I tell him that as he did it, and knows why he did it, if it was done for a reason different from this, _he knows what that reason was, and can tell us what it was_. I tell him, also, it will be vastly more satisfactory to the country for him to give some other plausible, intelligible reason _why_ it was voted down than to stand upon his dignity and call people liars. [Loud cheers.] Well, on Saturday he did make his answer, and what do you think it was? He says if I had only taken upon myself to tell the whole truth about that amendment of Chase's, no explanation would have been necessary on his part-or words to that effect. Now, I say here, that I am quite unconscious of having suppressed any thing material to the case, and I am very frank to admit if there is any sound reason other than that which appeared to me material, it is quite fair for him to present it. What reason does he propose? That when Chase came forward with his amendment expressly authorizing the people to exclude slavery from the limits of every Territory, Gen. Cass proposed to Chase, if he (Chase) would add to his amendment that the people should have the power to _introduce_ or exclude, they would let it go. (This is substantially all of his reply.) And because Chase would not do that, they voted his amendment down. Well, it turns out, I believe, upon examination, that General Cass took some part in the little running debate upon that amendment, and then ran away _and did not vote on it at all_. [Laughter.] Is not that the fact? So confident, as I think, was General Cass that there was a snake somewhere about, he chose to run away from the whole thing.This is an inference I draw from the fact that, though he took part in the debate, his name does not appear in the ayes and noes. But does Judge Douglas's reply amount to a satisfactory answer? [Cries of \"yes,\" \"yes,\" and \"no, \" \"no.\"] There is some little difference of opinion here. [Laughter.] But I ask attention to a few more views bearing on the question of whether it amounts to a satisfactory answer. The men who were determined that that amendment should not get into the bill and spoil the place where the Dred Scott decision was to come in, sought an excuse to get rid of it somewhere. One of these ways-one of these excuses-was to ask Chase to add to his proposed amendment a provision that the people might _introduce_ slavery if they wanted to. They very well knew Chase would do no such thing-that Mr. Chase was one of the men differing from them on the broad principle of his insisting that freedom was _better_ than slavery-a man who would not consent to enact a law, penned with his own hand, by which he was made to recognize slavery on the one hand and liberty on the other as _precisely equal_; and when they insisted on his doing this, they very well knew they insisted on that which he would not for a moment think of doing, and that they were only bluffing him. I believe (I have not, since he made his answer, had a chance to examine the journals or _Congressional Globe_, and therefore speak from memory) -I believe the state of the bill at that time, according to parliamentary rules, was such that no member could propose an additional amendment to Chase's amendment. I rather think this is the truth-the Judge shakes his head. Very well. I would like to know, then, _if they wanted Chase's amendment fixed over, why somebody else could not have offered to do it?_ If they wanted it amended, why did they not offer the amendment? Why did they stand there taunting and quibbling at Chase? Why did they not _put it in themselves?_ But to put it on the other ground; suppose that there was such an amendment offered, and Chase's was an amendment to an amendment; until one is disposed of by parliamentary law, you cannot pile another on. Then all these gentlemen had to do was to vote Chase's on, and then in the amended form in which the whole stood, add their own amendment to it if they wanted to put it in that shape. This was all they were obliged to do, and the ayes and noes show that there were 36 who voted it down, against 10 who voted in favor of it. The 36 held entire sway and control. They could in some form or other have put that bill in the exact shape they wanted. If there was a rule preventing their amending it at the time, they could pass that, and then Chase's amendment being merged, put it in the shape they wanted. They did not choose to do so, but they went into a quibble with Chase to get him to add what they knew he would not add, and because he would not, they stand upon that flimsy pretext for voting down what they argued was the meaning and intent of their own bill. They left room thereby for this Dred Scott decision, which goes very far to make slavery national throughout the United States.\n\nI pass one or two points I have because my time will very soon expire, but I must be allowed to say that Judge Douglas recurs again, as he did upon one or two other occasions, [to] the enormity of Lincoln-an insignificant individual like Lincoln-upon his _ipse dixit_ charging a conspiracy upon a large number of members of Congress, the Supreme Court and two Presidents, to nationalize slavery. I want to say that, in the first place, I have made no charge of this sort upon my _ipse dixit_. I have only arrayed the evidence tending to prove it, and presented it to the understanding of others, saying what I think it proves, but giving you the means of judging whether it proves it or not. This is precisely what I have done. I have not placed it upon my _ipse dixit_ at all. On this occasion, I wish to recall his attention to a piece of evidence which I brought forward at Ottawa on Saturday, showing that he had made substantially the _same charge_ against substantially the _same persons_, excluding his dear self from the category. I ask him to give some attention to the evidence which I brought forward, that he himself had discovered a \"fatal blow being struck\" against the right of the people to exclude slavery from their limits, which fatal blow he assumed as in evidence in an article in the Washington _Union_, published \"by authority.\" I ask by whose authority? He discovers a similar or identical provision in the Lecompton Constitution. Made by whom? The framers of that Constitution. Advocated by whom? By all the members of the party in the nation, who advocated the introduction of Kansas into the Union under the Lecompton Constitution.\n\nI have asked his attention to the evidence that he arrayed to prove that such a fatal blow was being struck, and to the facts which he brought forward in support of that charge-being identical with the one which he thinks so villainous in me. He pointed it not at a newspaper editor merely, but at the President and his Cabinet and the members of Congress advocating the Lecompton Constitution and those framing that instrument. I must again be permitted to remind him, that although my _ipse dixit_ may not be as great as his, yet it somewhat reduces the force of his calling my attention to the _enormity_ of my making a like charge against him. [Loud applause.]\n\nGo on, Judge Douglas.\n\n**Mr. Douglas' Speech**\n\nLadies and Gentlemen-The silence with which you have listened to Mr. Lincoln during his hour is creditable to this vast audience, composed of men of various political parties. Nothing is more honorable to any large mass of people assembled for the purpose of a fair discussion, than that kind and respectful attention that is yielded not only to your political friends, but to those who are opposed to you in politics.\n\nI am glad that at last I have brought Mr. Lincoln to the conclusion that he had better define his position on certain political questions to which I called his attention at Ottawa. He there showed no disposition, no inclination, to answer them. I did not present idle questions for him to answer merely for my gratification. I laid the foundation for those interrogatories by showing that they constituted the platform of the party whose nominee he is for the Senate. I did not presume that I had the right to catechise him as I saw proper, unless I showed that his party, or a majority of it, stood upon the platform and were in favor of the propositions upon which my questions were based. I desired simply to know, inasmuch as he had been nominated as the first, last, and only choice of his party, whether he concurred in the platform which that party had adopted for its government. In a few moments I will proceed to review the answers which he has given to these interrogatories; but in order to relieve his anxiety I will first respond to these which he has presented to me. Mark you, he has not presented interrogatories which have ever received the sanction of the party with which I am acting, and hence he has no other foundation for them than his own curiosity.(\"That's a fact.\")\n\nFirst, he desires to know if the people of Kansas shall form a Constitution by means entirely proper and unobjectionable and ask admission into the Union as a State, before they have the requisite population for a member of Congress, whether I will vote for that admission. Well, now, I regret exceedingly that he did not answer that interrogatory himself before he put it to me, in order that we might understand, and not be left to infer, on which side he is. (Good, good.) Mr. Trumbull, during the last session of Congress, voted from the beginning to the end against the admission of Oregon, although a free State, because she had not the requisite population for a member of Congress. (That's it.) Mr. Trumbull would not consent, under any circumstances, to let a State, free or slave, come into the Union until it had the requisite population. As Mr. Trumbull is in the field, fighting for Mr. Lincoln, I would like to have Mr. Lincoln answer his own question and tell me whether he is fighting Trumbull on that issue or not. (Good, put it to him, and cheers.) But I will answer his question. In reference to Kansas, it is my opinion, that as she has population enough to constitute a slave State, she has people enough for a free State. (Cheers.) I will not make Kansas an exceptional case to the other States of the Union. (Sound, and hear, hear.) I hold it to be a sound rule of universal application to require a Territory to contain the requisite population for a member of Congress, before it is admitted as a State into the Union. I made that proposition in the Senate in 1856, and I renewed it during the last session, in a bill providing that no Territory of the United States should form a Constitution and apply for admission until it had the requisite population. On another occasion I proposed that neither Kansas, or any other Territory, should be admitted until it had the requisite population. Congress did not adopt any of my propositions containing this general rule, but did make an exception of Kansas. I will stand by that exception. (Cheers.) Either Kansas must come in as a free State, with whatever population she may have, or the rule must be applied to all the other Territories alike. (Cheers.) I therefore answer at once, that it having been decided that Kansas has people enough for a slave State, I hold that she has enough for a free State. (\"Good,\" and applause.) I hope Mr. Lincoln is satisfied with my answer; (\"he ought to be,\" and cheers,) and now I would like to get his answer to his own interrogatory-whether or not he will vote to admit Kansas before she has the requisite population. (\"Hit himi again.\") I want to know whether he will vote to admit Oregon before that Territory has the requisite population. Mr. Trumbull will not, and the same reason that commits Mr. Trumbull against the admission of Oregon, commits him against Kansas, even if she should apply for admission as a free State. (\"You've got him,\" and cheers.) If there is any sincerity, any truth, in the argument of Mr. Trumbull in the Senate, against the admission of Oregon because she had not 93,420 people, although her population was larger than that of Kansas, he stands pledged against the admission of both Oregon and Kansas until they have 93,420 inhabitants. I would like Mr. Lincoln to answer this question. I would like him to take his own medicine. (Laughter.) If he differs with Mr. Trumbull, let him answer his argument against the admission of Oregon, instead of poking questions at me. (\"Right, good, good,\" laughter and cheers.)\n\nThe next question propounded to me by Mr. Lincoln is, can the people of a Territory in any lawful way, against the wishes of any citizen of the United States, exclude slavery from their limits prior to the formation of a State Constitution? I answer emphatically, as Mr. Lincoln has heard me answer a hundred times from every stump in Illinois, that in my opinion the people of a Territory can, by lawful means, exclude slavery from their limits prior to the formation of a State Constitution. Mr. Lincoln knew that I had answered that question over and over again. He heard me argue the Nebraska bill on that principle all over the State in 1854, in 1855, and in 1856, and he has no excuse for pretending to be in doubt as to my position on that question. It matters not what way the Supreme Court may hereafter decide as to the abstract question whether slavery may or may not go into a Territory under the Constitution, the people have the lawful means to introduce it or exclude it as they please, for the reason that slavery cannot exist a day or an hour anywhere, unless it is supported by local police regulations. (Right, right.) Those police regulations can only be established by the local legislature, and if the people are opposed to slavery they will elect representatives to that body who will by unfriendly legislation effectually prevent the introduction of it into their midst. If, on the contrary, they are for it, their legislation will favor its extension. Hence, no matter what the decision of the Supreme Court may be on that abstract question, still the right of the people to make a slave Territory or a free Territory is perfect and complete under the Nebraska bill. I hope Mr. Lincoln deems my answer satisfactory on that point.\n\n[Deacon Bross spoke.]\n\nIn this connection, I will notice the charge which he has introduced in relation to Mr. Chase's amendment. I thought that I had chased that amendment out of Mr. Lincoln's brain at Ottawa; (laughter) but it seems that still haunts his imagination, and he is not yet satisfied. I had supposed that he would be ashamed to press that question further. He is a lawyer, and has been a member of Congress, and has occupied his time and amused you by telling you about parliamentary proceedings. He ought to have known better than to try to palm off his miserable impositions upon this intelligent audience. (\"Good,\" and cheers.) The Nebraska bill provided that the legislative power, and authority of the said Territory, should extend to all rightful subjects of legislation consistent with the organic act and the Constitution of the United States. It did not make any exception as to slavery, but gave all the power that it was possible for Congress to give, without violating the Constitution to the Territorial Legislature, with no exception or limitation on the subject of slavery at all. The language of that bill which I have quoted, gave the full power and the full authority over the subject of slavery, affirmatively and negatively, to introduce it or exclude it, so far as the Constitution of the United States would permit. What more could Mr. Chase give by his amendment? Nothing. He offered his amendment for the identical purpose for which Mr. Lincoln is using it, to enable demagogues in the country to try and deceive the people. (\"Good, hit him again,\" and cheers.)\n\n[Deacon Bross spoke.]\n\nHis amendment was to this effect. It provided that the Legislature should have the power to exclude slavery: and General Cass suggested, \"why not give the power to introduce as well as exclude?\" The answer was, they have the power already in the bill to do both. Chase was afraid his amendment would be adopted if he put the alternative proposition and so make it fair both ways, but would not yield. He offered it for the purpose of having it rejected. He offered it, as he has himself avowed over and over again, simply to make capital out of it for the stump. He expected that it would be capital for small politicians in the country, and that they would make an effort to deceive the people with it, and he was not mistaken, for Lincoln is carrying out the plan admirably. (\"Good, good.\") Lincoln knows that the Nebraska bill, without Chase's amendment, gave all the power which the Constitution would permit. Could Congress confer any more? (\"No, no.\") Could Congress go beyond the Constitution of the country? We gave all a full grant, with no exception in regard to slavery one way or the other. We left that question as we left all others, to be decided by the people for themselves, just as they pleased. I will not occupy my time on this question. I have argued it before all over Illinois. I have argued it in this beautiful city of Freeport; I have argued it in the North, the South, the East, and the West, avowing the same sentiments and the same principles. I have not been afraid to avow my sentiments up here for fear I would be trotted down into Egypt. (Cheers and laughter.)\n\nThe third question which Mr. Lincoln presented is, if the Supreme Court of the United States shall decide that a State of this Union cannot exclude slavery from its own limits, will I submit to it? I am amazed that Lincoln should ask such a question. [\"A school boy knows better.\"] Yes, a school-boy does know better. Mr. Lincoln's object is to cast an imputation upon the Supreme Court. He knows that there never was but one man in America, claiming any degree of intelligence or decency, who ever for a moment pretended such a thing. It is true that the Washington _Union_, in an article published on the 17th of last December, did put forth that doctrine, and I denounced the article on the floor of the Senate, in a speech which Mr. Lincoln now pretends was against the President. The _Union_ had claimed that slavery had a right to go into the free States, and that any provision in the Constitution or laws of the free States to the contrary were null and void. I denounced it in the Senate, as I said before, and I was the first man who did. Lincoln's friends, Trumbull, and Seward, and Hale, and Wilson, land the whole Black Republican side of the Senate, were silent.They left it to me to denounce it. (Cheers.) And what was the reply made to me on that occasion? Mr. Toombs, of Georgia, got up and undertook to lecture me on the ground that I ought not to have deemed the article worthy of notice, and ought not to have replied to it; that there was not one man, woman or child south of the Potomac, in any slave State, who did not repudiate any such pretension. Mr. Lincoln knows that that reply was made on the spot, and yet now he asks this question. He might as well ask me, suppose Mr. Lincoln should steal a horse, would I sanction it; (laughter) and it would be as genteel in me to ask him, in the event he stole a horse, what ought to be done with him. He casts an imputation upon the Supreme Court of the United States, by supposing that they would violate the Constitution of the United States. I tell him that such a thing is not possible. (Cheers.) It would be an act of moral treason that no man on the bench could ever descend to. Mr. Lincoln himself would never in his partisan feelings so far forget what was right as to be guilty of such an act. (\"Good, good.\")\n\nThe fourth question of Mr. Lincoln is, are you in favor of acquiring additional territory, in disregard as to how such acquisition may affect the Union on the slavery questions? This question is very ingeniously and cunningly put.\n\n[Deacon Bross here spoke, _sotto voce_, - the reporter understanding him to say, \"Now we've got him.\"]\n\nThe Black Republican creed lays it down expressly, that under no circumstances shall we acquire any more territory unless slavery is first prohibited in the country. I ask Mr. Lincoln whether he is in favor of that proposition. Are you (addressing Mr. Lincoln) opposed to the acquisition of any more territory, under any circumstances, unless slavery is prohibited in it? That he does not like to answer. When I ask him whether he stands up to that article in the platform of his party, he turns, Yankee-fashion, and without answering it, asks me whether I am in favor of acquiring territory without regard to how it may affect the Union on the slavery question. (Good.) I answer that whenever it becomes necessary, in our growth and progress, to acquire more territory, that I am in favor of it, without reference to the question of slavery, and when we have acquired it, I will leave the people free to do as they please, either to make it slave or free territory, as they prefer. [Here Deacon Bross spoke, the reporter believes that he said, \"That's bold.\" It was said solemnly.] It is idle to tell me or you that we have territory enough. Our fathers supposed that we had enough when our territory extended to the Mississippi river, but a few years' growth and expansion satisfied them that we needed more, and the Louisiana territory, from the West branch of the Mississippi to the British possessions, was acquired. Then we acquired Oregon, then California and New Mexico. We have enough now for the present, but this is a young and a growing nation. It swarms as often as a hive of bees, and as new swarms are turned out each year, there must be hives in which they can gather and make their honey. (Good.) In less than fifteen years, if the same progress that has distinguished this country for the last fifteen years continues, every foot of vacant land between this and the Pacific ocean, owned by the United States, will be occupied.Will you not continue to increase at the end of fifteen years as well as now? I tell you, increase, and multiply, and expand, is the law of this nation's existence. (Good.) You cannot limit this great Republic by mere boundary lines, saying, \"thus far shalt thou go, and no further.\" Any one of you gentlemen might as well say to a son twelve years old that he is big enough, and must not grow any larger, and in order to prevent his growth put a hoop around him to keep him to his present size. What would be the result? Either the hoop must burst and be rent asunder, or the child must die. So it would be with this great nation. With our natural increase, growing with a rapidity unknown in any other part of the globe, with the tide of emigration that is fleeing from despotism in the old world to seek refuge in our own, there is a constant torrent pouring into this country that requires more land, more territory upon which to settle, and just as fast as our interests and our destiny require additional territory in the North, in the South, or on the Islands of the ocean, I am for it, and when we acquire it, will leave the people, according to the Nebraska bill, free to do as they please on the subject of slavery and every other question. (Good, good, hurra for Douglas.)\n\nI trust now that Mr. Lincoln will deem himself answered on his four points. He racked his brain so much in devising these four questions that he exhausted himself, and had not strength enough to invent the others. (Laughter.) As soon as he is able to hold a council with his advisers, Lovejoy, Farnsworth, and Fred Douglass, he will frame and propound others. [Good, good, &c. Renewed laughter, in which Mr. Lincoln feebly joined, saying that he hoped with their aid to get seven questions, the number asked him by Judge Douglas, and so make _conclusions_ even.] You Black Republicans who say good, I have no doubt think that they are all good men. (White, white.) I have reason to recollect that some people in this country think that Fred Douglass is a very good man. The last time I came here to make a speech, while talking from the stand to you, people of Freeport, as I am doing to-day, I saw a carriage, and a magnificent one it was, drive up and take a position on the outside of the crowd; a beautiful young lady was sitting on the box-seat, whilst Fred Douglass and her mother reclined inside, and the owner of the carriage acted as driver. (Laughter, cheers, cries of right, what have you to say against it, &c.) I saw this in your own town. (\"What of it.\") All I have to say of it is this, that if you, Black Republicans, think that the negro ought to be on a social equality with your wives and daughters, and ride in a carriage with your wife, whilst you drive the team, you have perfect right to do so. I am told that one of Fred Douglass' kinsmen, another rich black negro, is now traveling in this part of the State making speeches for his friend Lincoln as the champion of black men. (\"White men, white men,\" and \"what have you to say against it?\" That's right,&c.) All I have to say on that subject is, that those of you who believe that the negro is your equal and ought to be on an equality with you socially, politically, and legally, have a right to entertain those opinions, and of course will vote for Mr. Lincoln. (\"Down with the negro,\" no, no, &c.)\n\nI have a word to say on Mr. Lincoln's answer to the interrogatories contained in my speech at Ottawa, and which he has pretended to reply to here to-day. Mr. Lincoln makes a great parade of the fact that I quoted a platform as having been adopted by the Black Republican party at Springfield in 1854, which, it turns out, was adopted at another place. Mr. Lincoln loses sight of the thing itself in his ecstacies over the mistake I made in stating the place where it was done. He thinks that that platform was not adopted on the right \"spot.\"\n\nWhen I put the direct questions to Mr. Lincoln to ascertain whether he now stands pledged to that creed-to the unconditional repeal of the Fugitive Slave law, a refusal to admit any more slave States into the Union even if the people want them, a determination to apply the Wilmot Proviso, not only to all the territory we now have, but all that we may hereafter acquire, he refused to answer, and his followers say, in excuse, that the resolutions upon which I based my interrogatories were not adopted at the \"_right spot._\" (Laughter and applause.) Lincoln and his political friends are great on \"_spots_.\" (Renewed laughter.) In Congress, as a representative of this State, he declared the Mexican war to be unjust and infamous, and would not support it, or acknowledge his own country to be right in the contest, because he said that American blood was not shed on American soil in the \"_right spot._\" (Lay on to him.) And now he cannot answer the questions I put to him at Ottawa because the resolutions I read were not adopted at the \"_right spot_.\" It may be possible that I was led into an error as to the _spot_ on which the resolutions I then read were proclaimed, but I was not, and am not in error as to the fact of their forming the basis of the creed of the Republican party when that party was first organized. [Cheers.] I will state to you the evidence I had, and upon which I relied for my statement that the resolutions in question were adopted at Springfield on the 5th of October, 1854. Although I was aware that such resolutions had been passed in this district, and nearly all the northern Congressional Districts and County Conventions, I had not noticed whether or not they had been adopted by any State Convention. In 1856, a debate arose in Congress between Major Thomas L. Harris, of the Springfield District, and Mr. Norton, of the Joliet District, on political matters connected with our State, in the course of which, Major Harris quoted those resolutions as having been passed by the first Republican State Convention that ever assembled in Illinois. I knew that Major Harris was remarkable for his accuracy, that he was a very conscientious and sincere man, and I also noticed that Norton did not question the accuracy of this statement.I therefore took it for granted that it was so, and the other day when I concluded to use the resolutions at Ottawa, I wrote to Charles H. Lanphier, editor of the _State Register_, at Springfield, calling his attention to them, telling him that I had been informed that Major Harris was lying sick at Springfield, and desiring him to call upon him and ascertain all the facts concerning the resolutions, the time and the place where they were adopted. In reply, Mr. Lanphier sent me two copies of his paper, which I have here. The first is a copy of the _State Register_, published at Springfield, Mr. Lincoln's own town, on the 16th of October 1854, only eleven days after the adjournment of the Convention, from which I desire to read the following:\n\n\"During the late discussions in this city, Lincoln made a speech, to which Judge Douglas replied. In Lincoln's speech he took the broad ground that, according to the Declaration of Independence, the whites and blacks are equal. From this he drew the conclusion, which he several times repeated, that the white man had no right to pass laws for the government of the black man without the nigger's consent. This speech of Lincoln's was heard and applauded by all the Abolitionists assembled in Springfield. So soon as Mr. Lincoln was done speaking, Mr. Codding arose and requested all the delegates to the Black Republican Convention to withdraw into the Senate chamber. They did so, and after long deliberation, they laid down the following Abolition platform as the platform on which they stood. We call the particular attention of all our readers to it.\"\n\nThen follows the identical platform, word for word, which I read at Ottawa. (Cheers.) Now, that was published in Mr. Lincoln's own town, eleven days after the Convention was held, and it has remained on record up to this day never contradicted.\n\nWhen I quoted the resolutions at Ottawa and questioned Mr. Lincoln in relation to them, he said that his name was on the committee that reported them, but he did not serve, nor did he think he served, because he was, or thought he was, in Tazewell county at the time the Convention was in session. He did not deny that the resolutions were passed by the Springfield Convention. He did not know better, and evidently thought that they were, but afterward his friends declared that they had discovered that they varied in some respects from the resolutions passed by that Convention. I have shown you that I had good evidence for believing that the resolutions had been passed at Springfield. Mr. Lincoln ought to have known better; but not a word is said about his ignorance on the subject, whilst I, notwithstanding the circumstances, am accused of forgery.\n\nNow, I will show you that if I have made a mistake as to the place where these resolutions were adopted-and when I get down to Springfield I will investigate the matter and see whether or not I have-that the principles they enunciate were adopted as the Black Republican platform (white, white,) in the various counties and Congressional Districts throughout the north end of the State in 1854. This platform was adopted in nearly every county that gave a Black Republican majority for the Legislature in that year, and here is a man (pointing to Mr. Denio, who sat on the stand near Deacon Bross) who knows as well as any living man that it was the creed of the Black Republican party at that time. I would be willing to call Denio as a witness, or any other honest man belonging to that party. I will now read the resolutions adopted at the Rockford Convention on the 30th of August, 1854, which nominated Washburne for Congress. You elected him on the following platform:\n\n_Resolved_, That the continued and increasing aggressions of slavery in our country are destructive of the best rights of a free people, and that such aggressions cannot be successfully resisted without the united political action of all good men.\n\n_Resolved_, That the citizens of the United States hold in their hands peaceful, constitutional and efficient remedy against the encroachments of the slave power, the ballot-box, and, if that remedy is boldly and wisely applied, the principles of liberty and eternal justice will be established.\n\n_Resolved_, That we accept this issue forced upon us by the slave power, and, in defense of freedom, will co-operate and be known as Republicans, pledged to the accomplishment of the following purposes:\n\nTo bring the Administration of the Government back to the control of first principles; to restore Kansas and Nebraska to the position of free Territories; to repeal and entirely abrogate the Fugitive Slave law; to restrict slavery to those States in which it exists; to prohibit the admission of any more slave States into the Union; to exclude slavery from all the Territories over which the General Government has exclusive jurisdiction, and to resist the acquisition of any more Territories unless the introduction of slavery therein forever shall have been prohibited.\n\n_Resolved_, That in furtherance of these principles we will use such constitutional and lawful means as shall seem best adapted to their accomplishment, and that we will support no man for office under the General or State Government who is not positively committed to the support of these principles, and whose personal character and conduct is not a guaranty that he is reliable and shall abjure all party allegiance and ties.\n\n_Resolved_, That we cordially invite persons of all former political parties whatever in favor of the object expressed in the above resolutions to unite with us in carrying them into effect.\n\n[Senator Douglas was frequently interrupted in reading these resolutions by loud cries of \"Good,good,\" \"that's the doctrine,\" and vociferous applause.]\n\nWell, you think that is a very good platform, do you not? (\"Yes, yes, all right,\" and cheers.) If you do, if you approve it now, and think it is all right, you will not join with those men who say that I libel you by calling these your principles, will you? (\"Good, good, hit him again,\" and great laughter and cheers.) Now, Mr. Lincoln complains; Mr. Lincoln charges that I did you and him injustice by saying that this was the platform of your party. (Renewed laughter.) I am told that Washburne made a speech in Galena last night, in which he abused me awfully for bringing to light this platform, on which he was elected to Congress. He thought that you had forgotten it, as he and Mr. Lincoln desire to. (Laughter.) He did not deny but that you had adopted it, and that he had subscribed to and was pledged by it, but he did not think it was fair to call it up and remind the people that it was their platform.\n\n[Here Deacon Bross spoke.]\n\nBut I am glad to find you are more honest in your abolitionism than your leaders, by avowing that it is your platform, and right in your opinion. (Laughter, \"you have them, good, good.\")\n\nIn the adoption of that platform, you not only declared that you would resist the admission of any more slave States, and work for the repeal of the Fugitive Slave law, but you pledged yourselves not to vote for any man for State or Federal offices who was not committed to these principles. You were thus committed. Similar resolutions to those were adopted in your county Convention here, and now with your admissions that they are your platform and embody your sentiments now as they did then, what do you think of Mr. Lincoln, your candidate for the U. S. Senate, who is attempting to dodge the responsibility of this platform, because it was not adopted in the right spot. I thought that it was adopted in Springfield, but it turns out it was not, that it was adopted at Rockford, and in the various counties which comprise this Congressional District. When I get into the next district, I will show that the same platform was adopted there, and so on through the State, until I nail the responsibility of it upon the back of the Black Republican party throughout the State. (\"White, white,\" three cheers for Douglas.)\n\nA voice- \"Couldn't you modify and call it brown?\" (laughter)\n\nMr. Douglas-Not a bit. I thought that you were becoming a little brown when your members in Congress voted for the Crittenden-Montgomery bill, but since you have backed out from that position and gone back to Abolitionism, you are black and not brown. (Shouts of laughter, and a voice, \"Can't you ask him another question.\")\n\nGentlemen, I have shown you what your platform was in 1854.You still adhere to it. The same platform was adopted by nearly all the counties where the Black Republican party had a majority in 1854. I wish now to call your attention to the action of your representatives in the Legislature when they assembled together at Springfield. In the first place, you must remember that this was the organization of a new party. It is so declared in the resolutions themselves, which say that you are going to dissolve all old party ties and call the new party Republican. The old Whig party was to have its throat cut from ear to ear, and the Democratic party was to be annihilated and blotted out of existence, whilst in lieu of these parties the Black Republican party was to be organized on this Abolition platform. You know who the chief leaders were in breaking up and destroying these two great parties. Lincoln on the one hand and Trumbull on the other, being disappointed politicians, and having retired or been driven to obscurity by an outraged constituency because of their political sins, formed a scheme to abolitionize the two parties and lead the old line Whigs and old line Democrats captive, bound hand and foot, into the Abolition camp. Giddings, Chase, Fred Douglass and Lovejoy were here to christen them whenever they were brought in. Lincoln went to work to dissolve the old line Whig party. Clay was dead, and although the sod was not yet green on his grave, this man undertook to bring into disrepute those great Compromise measures of 1850, with which Clay and Webster were identified. Up to 1854 the old Whig party and the Democratic party had stood on a common platform so far as this slavery question was concerned. You Whigs and we Democrats differed about the bank, the tariff, distribution, the specie circular and the sub-treasury, but we agreed on this slavery question and the true mode of preserving the peace and harmony of the Union. The Compromise measures of 1850 were introduced by Clay, were defended by Webster, and supported by Cass, and were approved by Fillmore, and sanctioned by the National men of both parties. They constituted a common plank upon which both Whigs and Democrats stood. In 1852 the Whig party, in its last National Convention at Baltimore, indorsed and approved these measures of Clay, and so did the National Convention of the Democratic party, held that same year. Thus the old line Whigs and the old line Democrats stood pledged to the great principle of self-government, which guaranties to the people of each Territory the right to decide the slavery question for themselves. In 1854, after the death of Clay and Webster, Mr. Lincoln, on the part of the Whigs, undertook to Abolitionize the Whig party, by dissolving it, transferring the members into the Abolition camp and making them train under Giddings, Fred Douglass, Lovejoy, Chase, Farnsworth, and other Abolition leaders. Trumbull undertook to dissolve the Democratic party by taking old Democrats into the Abolition camp. Mr. Lincoln was aided in his efforts by many leading Whigs throughout the State. Your member of Congress, Mr. Washburne, being one of the most active. Trumbull was aided by many renegades from the Democratic party, among whom were John Wentworth, Tom Turner, and others, with whom you are familiar.\n\n[Mr. Turner, who was one of the moderators, here interposed and said that he had drawn the resolutions which Senator Douglas had read.]\n\nMr. Douglas-Yes, and Turner says that he drew these resolutions. [\"Hurra for Turner, \" \"Hurra for Douglas.\"] That is right, give Turner cheers for drawing the resolutions if you approve them. If he drew those resolutions he will not deny that they are the creed of the Black Republican party.\n\nMr. Turner-\" They are our creed exactly.\"\n\nMr. Douglas-And yet Lincoln denies that he stands on them. Mr. Turner says that the creed of the Black Republican party is the admission of no more slave States, and yet Mr. Lincoln declares that he would not like to be placed in a position where he would have to vote for them. All I have to say to friend Lincoln is, that I do not think there is much danger of his being placed in such a position. As Mr. Lincoln would be very sorry to be placed in such an embarrassing position as to be obliged to vote on the admission of any more slave States, I propose, out of mere kindness, to relieve him from any such necessity.\n\nWhen the bargain between Lincoln and Trumbull was completed for Abolitionizing the Whig and Democratic parties, they \"spread\" over the State, Lincoln still pretending to be an old line Whig, in order to \"rope in\" the Whigs, and Trumbull pretending to be as good a Democrat as he ever was, in order to coax the Democrats over into the Abolition ranks. They played the part that \"decoy ducks\" play down on the Potomac river. In that part of the country they make artificial ducks and put them on the water in places where the wild ducks are to be found, for the purpose of decoying them. Well, Lincoln and Trumbull played the part of these \"decoy ducks\" and deceived enough old line Whigs and old line Democrats to elect a Black Republican Legislature. When that Legislature met, the first thing it did was to elect as Speaker of the House, the very man who is now boasting that he wrote the Abolition platform on which Lincoln will not stand. I want to know of Mr. Turner whether or not, when he was elected, he was a good embodiment of Republican principles?\n\nMr. Turner-\" I hope I was then and am now.\"\n\nMr. Douglas-He swears that he hopes he was then and is now. He wrote that Black Republican platform, and is satisfied with it now. I admire and acknowledge Turner's honesty. Every man of you know that what he says about these resolutions being the platform of the Black Republican party is true, and you also know that each one of these men who are shuffling and trying to deny it are only trying to cheat the people out of their votes for the purpose of deceiving them still more after the election. I propose to trace this thing a little further, in order that you can see what additional evidence there is to fasten this revolutionary platform upon the Black Republican party. When the Legislature assembled, there was an United States Senator to elect in the place of Gen. Shields, and before they proceeded to ballot, Lovejoy insisted on laying down certain principles by which to govern the party. It has been published to the world and satisfactorily proven that there was, at the time the alliance was made between Trumbull and Lincoln to Abolitionize the two parties, an agreement that Lincoln should take Shields's place in the United States Senate, and Trumbull should have mine so soon as they could conveniently get rid of me. When Lincoln was beaten for Shields's place, in a manner I will refer to in a few minutes, he felt very sore and restive; his friends grumbled, and some of them came out and charged that the most infamous treachery had been practiced against him; that the bargain was that Lincoln was to have had Shields's place, and Trumbull was to have waited for mine, but that Trumbull having the control of a few Abolitionized Democrats, he prevented them from voting for Lincoln, thus keeping him within a few votes of an election until he succeeded in forcing the party to drop him and elect Trumbull. Well, Trumbull having cheated Lincoln, his friends made a fuss, and in order to keep them and Lincoln quiet, the party were obliged to come forward, in advance, at the last State election, and make a pledge that they would go for Lincoln and nobody else. Lincoln could not be silenced in any other way.\n\nNow, there are a great many Black Republicans of you who do not know this thing was done. [\"White, white,\" and great clamor.] I wish to remind you that while Mr. Lincoln was speaking there was not a Democrat vulgar and blackguard enough to interrupt him. But I know that the shoe is pinching you. I am clinching Lincoln now, and you are scared to death for the result. I have seen this thing before. I have seen men make appointments for joint discussions, and the moment their man has been heard, try to interrupt and prevent a fair hearing of the other side. I have seen your mobs before, and defy your wrath. [Tremendous applause.] My friends, do not cheer, for I need my whole time. The object of the opposition is to occupy my attention in order to prevent me from giving the whole evidence and nailing this double dealing on the Black Republican party. As I have before said, Lovejoy demanded a declaration of principles on the part of the Black Republicans of the Legislature before going into an election for United States Senator. He offered the following preamble and resolutions which I hold in my hand:\n\nWHEREAS, Human slavery is a violation of the principles of natural and revealed rights; and whereas, the fathers of the Revolution, fully imbued with the spirit of these principles, declared freedom to be the inalienable birthright of all men; and whereas, the preamble to the Constitution of the United States avers that that instrument was ordained to establish justice, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity; and whereas, in furtherance of the above principles, slavery was forever prohibited in the old North-west Territory, and more recently in all that Territory lying west and north of the State of Missouri, by the act of the Federal Government; and whereas, the repeal of the prohibition last referred to, was contrary to the wishes of the people of Illinois, a violation of an implied compact, long deemed sacred by the citizens of the United States, and a wide departure from the uniform action of the General Government in relation to the extension of slavery; therefore,\n\n_Resolved, by the House of Representatives, the Senate concurring therein_, That our Senators in Congress be instructed, and our Representatives requested to introduce, if not otherwise introduced, and to vote for a bill to restore such prohibition to the aforesaid Territories, and also to extend a similar prohibition to all territory which now belongs to the United States, or which may hereafter come under their jurisdiction.\n\n_Resolved_, That our Senators in Congress be instructed, and our Representatives requested, to vote against the admission of any State into the Union, the Constitution of which does not prohibit slavery, whether the territory out of which such State may have been formed shall have been acquired by conquest, treaty, purchase, or from original territory of the United States.\n\n_Resolved,_ That our Senators in Congress be instructed, and our Representatives requested, to introduce and vote for a bill to repeal an act entitled \"an act respecting fugitives from justice and persons escaping from the service of their masters;\" and, failing in that, for such a modification of it as shall secure the right of _habeas corpus_ and trial by jury before the regularly-constituted authorities of the State, to all persons claimed as owing service or labor.\n\n(Cries of \"good,\" \"good,\" and cheers.) Yes, you say \"good,\" \"good,\" and I have no doubt you think so. Those resolutions were introduced by Mr. Lovejoy immediately preceding the election of Senator. They declared first, that the Wilmot Proviso must be applied to all territory north of 36 deg. 30 min. Secondly, that it must be applied to all territory south of 36 deg. 30 min. Thirdly, that it must be applied to all the territory now owned by the United States, and finally, that it must be applied to all territory hereafter to be acquired by the United States. The next resolution declares that no more slave States shall be admitted into this Union under any circumstances whatever, no matter whether they are formed out of territory now owned by us or that we may hereafter acquire, by treaty, by Congress, or in any manner whatever. The next resolution demands the unconditional repeal of the Fugitive Slave law, although its unconditional repeal would leave no provision for carrying out that clause of the Constitution of the United States which guaranties the surrender of fugitives. If they could not get an unconditional repeal, they demanded that that law should be so modified as to make it as nearly useless as possible. Now, I want to show you who voted for these resolutions. When the vote was taken on the first resolution it was decided in the affirmative-yeas 41, nays 32. You will find that this is a strict party vote, between the Democrats on the one hand, and the Black Republicans on the other. [Cries of \"White, white,\" and clamor.] I know your name, and always call things by their right name. The point I wish to call your attention to, is this: that these resolutions were adopted on the 7th day of February, and that on the 8th they went into an election for a United States Senator, and that day every man who voted for these resolutions, with but two exceptions, voted for Lincoln for the United States Senate. [\"Give us their names.\"] I will read the names over to you if you want them, but I believe your object is to occupy my time.\n\nOn the next resolution the vote stood-yeas 33, nays 40, and on the third resolution-yeas 35, nays 47. I wish to impress it upon you, that every man who voted for those resolutions, with but two exceptions, voted on the next day for Lincoln for U. S. Senator. Bear in mind that the members who thus voted for Lincoln were elected to the Legislature pledged to vote for no man for office under the State or Federal Government who was not committed to this Black Republican platform. They were all so pledged. Mr. Turner, who stands by me, and who then represented you, and who says that he wrote those resolutions, voted for Lincoln, when he was pledged not to do so unless Lincoln was in favor of those resolutions. I now ask Mr. Turner [turning to Mr. Turner], did you violate your pledge in voting for Mr. Lincoln, or did he commit himself to your platform before you cast your vote for him?\n\nI could go through the whole list of names here and show you that all the Black Republicans in the Legislature, who voted for Mr. Lincoln, had voted on the day previous for these resolutions. For instance, here are the names of Sargent and Little of Jo Daviess and Carroll, Thomas J. Turner of Stephenson, Lawrence of Boone and McHenry, Swan of Lake, Pinckney of Ogle county, and Lyman of Winnebago. Thus you see every member from your Congressional District voted for Mr. Lincoln, and they were pledged not to vote for him unless he was committed to the doctrine of no more slave States, the prohibition of slavery in the Territories, and the repeal of the Fugitive Slave law. Mr. Lincoln tells you today that he is not pledged to any such doctrine. Either Mr. Lincoln was then committed to those propositions, or Mr. Turner violated his pledges to you when he voted for him. Either Lincoln was pledged to each one of those propositions, or else every Black Republican Representative from this Congressional District violated his pledge of honor to his constituents by voting for him. I ask you which horn of the dilemma will you take? Will you hold Lincoln up to the platform of his party, or will you accuse every Representative you had in the Legislature of violating his pledge of honor to his constituents? There is no escape for you. Either Mr. Lincoln was committed to those propositions, or your members violated their faith. Take either horn of the dilemma you choose. There is no dodging the question; I want Lincoln's answer. He says he was not pledged to repeal the Fugitive Slave law, that he does not quite like to do it; he will not introduce a law to repeal it, but thinks there ought to be some law; he does not tell what it ought to be; upon the whole, he is altogether undecided, and don't know what to think or do. That is the substance of his answer upon the repeal of the Fugitive Slave law. I put the question to him distinctly, whether he indorsed that part of the Black Republican platform which calls for the entire abrogation and repeal of the Fugitive Slave law. He answers no! that he does not indorse that, but he does not tell what he is for, or what he will vote for. His answer is, in fact, no answer at all. Why cannot he speak out and say what he is for and what he will do?\n\nIn regard to there being no more slave States, he is not pledged to that. He would not like, he says, to be put in a position where he would have to vote one way or another upon that question. I pray you, do not put him in a position that would embarrass him so much. Gentlemen, if he goes to the Senate, he may be put in that position, and then which way will he vote?\n\n[A Voice-''How will you vote?\"]\n\nMr. Douglas-I will vote for the admission of just such a State as by the form of their Constitution the people show they want; if they want slavery, they shall have it; if they prohibit slavery it shall be prohibited. They can form their institutions to please themselves, subject only to the Constitution; and I for one stand ready to receive them into the Union. Why cannot your Black Republican candidates talk out as plain as that when they are questioned?\n\nI do not want to cheat any man out of his vote. No man is deceived in regard to my principles if I have the power to express myself in terms explicit enough to convey my ideas.\n\nMr. Lincoln made a speech when he was nominated for the United States Senate which covers all these Abolition platforms. He there lays down a proposition so broad in its abolitionism as to cover the whole ground.\n\n\"In my opinion it [the slavery agitation] will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed. 'A house divided against itself cannot stand.' I believe this Government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the house to fall-but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or all the other. Either the opponents of Slavery will arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction, or its advocates will push it forward till it shall become alike lawful in all the States-old as well as new, North as well as South.\"\n\nThere you find that Mr. Lincoln lays down the doctrine that this Union cannot endure divided as our fathers made it, with free and slave States. He says they must all become one thing, or all the other; that they must all be free or all slave, or else the Union cannot continue to exist. It being his opinion that to admit any more slave States, to continue to divide the Union into free and slave States, will dissolve it. I want to know of Mr. Lincoln whether he will vote for the admission of another slave State.\n\nHe tells you the Union cannot exist unless the States are all free or all slave; he tells you that he is opposed to making them all slave, and hence he is for making them all free, in order that the Union may exist; and yet he will not say that he will not vote against another slave State, knowing that the Union must be dissolved if he votes for it. I ask you if that is fair dealing? The true intent and inevitable conclusion to be drawn from his first Springfield speech is, that he is opposed to the admission of any more slave States under any circumstance. If he is so opposed, why not say so? If he believes this Union cannot endure divided into free and slave States, that they must all become free in order to save the Union, he is bound as an honest man, to vote against any more slave States. If he believes it he is bound to do it. Show me that it is my duty in order to save the Union to do a particular act, and I will do it if the Constitution does not prohibit it. (Applause.) I am not for the dissolution of the Union under any circumstances. (Renewed applause.) I will pursue no course of conduct that will give just cause for the dissolution of the Union. The hope of the friends of freedom throughout the world rests upon the perpetuity of this Union. The down-trodden and oppressed people who are suffering under European despotism all look with hope and anxiety to the American Union as the only resting place and permanent home of freedom and self-government.\n\nMr. Lincoln says that he believes that this Union cannot continue to endure with slave States in it, and yet he will not tell you distinctly whether he will vote for or against the admission of any more slave States, but says he would not like to be put to the test. (Laughter.) I do not think he will be put to the test. (Renewed laughter.) I do not think that the people of Illinois desire a man to represent them who would not like to be put to the test on the performance of a high constitutional duty. (Cries of good.) I will retire in shame from the Senate of the United States when I am not willing to be put to the test in the performance of my duty. I have been put to severe tests. (That is so.) I have stood by my principles in fair weather and in foul, in the sunshine and in the rain. I have defended the great principles of self-government here among you when Northern sentiment ran in a torrent against me, (A VOICE,-that is so,) and I have defended that same great principle when Southern sentiment came down like an avalanche upon me. I was not afraid of any test they put to me. I knew I was right-I knew my principles were sound-I knew that the people would see in the end that I had done right, and I knew that the God of Heaven would smile upon me if I was faithful in the performance of my duty. (Cries of good, cheers, and laughter.)\n\nMr. Lincoln makes a charge of corruption against the Supreme Court of the United States, and two Presidents of the United States, and attempts to bolster it up by saying that I did the same against the Washington _Union_. Suppose I did make that charge of corruption against the Washington _Union_, when it was true, does that justify him in making a false charge against me and others? That is the question I would put. He says that at the time the Nebraska bill was introduced, and before it was passed, there was a conspiracy between the Judges of the Supreme Court, President Pierce, President Buchanan and myself by that bill, and the decision of the court to break down the barrier and establish slavery all over the Union. Does he not know that that charge is historically false as against President Buchanan? He knows that Mr. Buchanan was at that time in England, representing this country with distinguished ability at the Court of St. James, that he was there for a long time before, and did not return for a year or more after. He knows that to be true, and that fact proves his charge to be false as against Mr. Buchanan. (Cheers.) Then again, I wish to call his attention to the fact that at the time the Nebraska bill was passed, the Dred Scott case was not before the Supreme Court at all; it was not upon the docket of the Supreme Court; it had not been brought there, and the Judges in all probability knew nothing of it. Thus the history of the country proves the charge to be false as against them. As to President Pierce, his high character as a man of integrity and honor is enough to vindicate him from such a charge, (laughter and applause,) and as to myself, I pronounce the charge an infamous lie, whenever and wherever made, and by whomsoever made. I am willing that Mr. Lincoln should go and rake up every public act of mine, every measure I have introduced, report I have made, speech delivered, and criticise them, but when he charges upon me a corrupt conspiracy for the purpose of perverting the institutions of the country, I brand it as it deserves. I say the history of the country proves it to be false, and that it could not have been possible at the time. But now he tries to protect himself in this charge, because I made a charge against the Washington _Union_. My speech in the Senate against the Washington _Union_ was made because it advocated a revolutionary doctrine, by declaring that the free States had not the right to prohibit slavery within their own limits. Because I made that charge against the Washington _Union_, Mr. Lincoln says it was a charge against Mr. Buchanan. Suppose it was; is Mr. Lincoln the peculiar defender of Mr. Buchanan? Is he so interested in the Federal Administration, and so bound to it, that he must jump to the rescue and defend it from every attack that I may make against it? (Great laughter and cheers.) I understand the whole thing. The Washington _Union_, under that most corrupt of all men, Cornelius Wendell, is advocating Mr. Lincoln's claim to the Senate. Wendell was the printer of the last Black Republican House of Representatives; he was a candidate before the present Democratic House, but was ignominiously kicked out, and then he took the money which he had made out of the public printing by means of the Black Republicans, bought the Washington _Union_, and is now publishing it in the name of the Democratic party, and advocating Mr. Lincoln's election to the Senate. Mr. Lincoln therefore considers an attack upon Wendell and his corrupt gang as a personal attack upon him. (Immense cheering and laughter.) This only proves what I have charged, that there is an alliance between Lincoln and his supporters, and the Federal office-holders of this State, and Presidential aspirants out of it, to break me down at home.\n\n[A VOICE.-That is impossible, and cheering.]\n\nMr. Lincoln feels bound to come in to the rescue of the Washington _Union_. In that speech which I delivered in answer to the Washington _Union_, I made it distinctly against the _Union_, and against the _Union_ alone. I did not choose to go beyond that. If I have occasion to attack the President's conduct, I will do it in language that will not be misunderstood. When I differed with the President, I spoke out so that you all heard me. (\"That you did,\" and cheers.) That question passed away; it resulted in the triumph of my principle by allowing the people to do as they please, and there is an end of the controversy. Whenever the great principle of self-government-the right of the people to make their own Constitution, and come into the Union with slavery or without it, as they see proper, shall again arise, you will find me standing firm in defense of that principle, and fighting whoever fights it. (\"Right, right.\" \"Good, good,\" and cheers.) If Mr. Buchanan stands, as I doubt not he will, by the recommendation contained in his Message, that hereafter all State Constitutions ought to be submitted to the people before the admission of the State into the Union, he will find me standing by him firmly, shoulder to shoulder, in carrying it out. I know Mr. Lincoln's object; he wants to divide the Democratic party, in order that he may defeat me and get to the Senate.\n\nMr. Douglas' time here expired, and he stopped on the moment.\n\n**Mr. Lincon's Reply**\n\nAs Mr. Lincoln arose he was greeted with vociferous cheers. He said:\n\nMy friends: It will readily occur to you that I cannot, in half an hour, notice all the things that so able a man as Judge Douglas can say in an hour and a half; and I hope, therefore, if there be any thing that he has said upon which you would like to hear something from me, but which I omit to comment upon, you will bear in mind that it would be expecting an impossibility for me to go over his whole ground. I can but take up some of the points that he has dwelt upon, and employed my half-hour specially on them.\n\nThe first thing I have to say to you is a word in regard to Judge Douglas's declaration about the \"vulgarity and blackguardism\" in the audience-that no such thing, as he says, was shown by any Democrat while I was speaking. Now, I only wish, by way of reply on this subject, to say that while _I_ was speaking, _I_ used no \"vulgarity or blackguardism\" toward any Democrat. [Great laughter and applause.]\n\nNow, my friends, I come to all this long portion of the Judge's speech-perhaps half of it-which he has devoted to the various resolutions and platforms that have been adopted in the different counties in the different Congressional Districts, and in the Illinois Legislature-which he supposes are at variance with the positions I have assumed before you to-day. It is true that many of these resolutions are at variance with the positions I have here assumed. All I have to ask is that we talk reasonably and rationally about it. I happen to know, the Judge's opinion to the contrary notwithstanding, that I have never tried to conceal my opinions, nor tried to deceive any one in reference to them. He may go and examine all the members who voted for me for United States Senator in 1855, after the election of 1854. They were pledged to certain things here at home, and were determined to have pledges from me, and if he will find any of these persons who will tell him any thing inconsistent with what I say now, I will resign, or rather retire from the race, and give him no more trouble. [Applause.] The plain truth is this: At the introduction of the Nebraska policy, we believed there was a new era being introduced in the history of the Republic, which tended to the spread and perpetuation of slavery.But in our opposition to that measure we did not agree with one another in every thing. The people in the north end of the State were for stronger measures of opposition than we of the central and Southern portions of the State, but we were all opposed to the Nebraska doctrine. We had that one feeling and that one sentiment in common. You at the north end met in your Conventions and passed your resolutions. We in the middle of the State and further south did not hold such Conventions and pass the same resolutions, although we had in general a common view and a common sentiment. So that these meetings which the Judge has alluded to, and the resolutions he has read from, were local, and did not spread over the whole State. We at last met together in 1856, from all parts of the State, and we agreed upon a common platform. You, who held more extreme notions, either yielded those notions, or if not wholly yielding them, agreed to yield them practically, for the sake of embodying the opposition to the measures which the opposite party were pushing forward at that time. We met you then, and if there was any thing yielded, it was for practical purposes. We agreed then upon a platform for the party throughout the entire State of Illinois, and now we are all bound as a party, _to that platform_. And I say here to you, if any one expects of me-in the case of my election-that I will do any thing not signified by our Republican platform and my answers here to-day, I tell you very frankly that person will be deceived. I do not ask for the vote of any one who supposes that I have secret purposes or pledges that I dare not speak out. Cannot the Judge be satisfied? If he fears, in the unfortunate case of my election, [Laughter.] that my going to Washington will enable me to advocate sentiments contrary to those which I expressed when you voted for and elected me, I assure him that his fears are wholly needless and groundless. Is the Judge really afraid of any such thing? [Laughter.] I'll tell you what he is afraid of. _He is afraid we'll all pull together_. [Applause, and cries of \"we will, we will.\"] This is what alarms him more than anything else. [Laughter.] For my part, I do hope that all of us, entertaining a common sentiment in opposition to what appears to us a design to nationalize and perpetuate slavery, will waive minor differences on questions which either belong to the dead pastor the distant future, and all pull together in this struggle. What are your sentiments? [\"We will, we will,\" and loud cheers.] If it be true, that on the ground which I occupy-ground which I occupy as frankly and boldly as Judge Douglas does his-my views, though partly coinciding with yours, are not as perfectly in accordance with your feelings as his are, I do say to you in all candor, go for him and not for me. I hope to deal in all things fairly with Judge Douglas, and with the people of the State, in this contest. And if I should never be elected to any office, I trust I may go down with no stain of falsehood upon my reputation-notwithstanding the hard opinions Judge Douglas chooses to entertain of me. [Laughter.]\n\nThe Judge has again addressed himself to the abolition tendencies of a speech of mine, made at Springfield in June last. I have so often tried to answer what he is always saying on that melancholy theme, that I almost turn with disgust from the discussion - from the repetition of an answer to it. I trust that nearly all of this intelligent audience have read that speech. [\"We have; we have.\"] If you have, I may venture to leave it to you to inspect it closely, and see whether it contains any of those \"bugaboos\" which frighten Judge Douglas. [Laughter.]\n\nThe Judge complains that I did not fully answer his questions. If I have the sense to comprehend and answer those questions, I have done so fairly. If it can be pointed out to me how I can more fully and fairly answer him, I aver I have not the sense to see how it is to be done. He says I do not declare I would in any event vote for the admission of a slave State into the Union. If I have been fairly reported he will see that I did give an explicit answer to his interrogatories, I did not merely say that I would dislike to be put to the test; but I said clearly, if I were put to the test, and a Territory from which slavery had been excluded should present herself with a State Constitution sanctioning slavery-a most extraordinary thing and wholly unlikely to happen-I did not see how I could avoid voting for her admission. But he refuses to understand that I said so, and he wants this audience to understand that I did not say so. Yet it will be so reported in the printed speech that he cannot help seeing it.\n\nHe says if I should vote for the admission of a slave State I would be voting for a dissolution of the Union, because I hold that the Union cannot permanently exist half slave and half free. I repeat that I do not believe this Government _can_ endure permanently half slave and half free, yet I do not admit, nor does it at all follow, that the admission of a single slave State will permanently fix the character and establish this as a universal slave nation. The Judge is very happy indeed at working up these quibbles. [Laughter and cheers.] Before leaving the subject of answering questions I aver as my confident belief, when you come to see our speeches in print, that you will find every question which he has asked me more fairly and boldly and fully answered than he has answered those which I put to him. Is not that so? [Cries of yes, yes] The two speeches may be placed side by side; and I will venture to leave it to impartial judges whether his questions have not been more directly and circumstantially answered than mine.\n\nJudge Douglas says he made a charge upon the editor of the Washington _Union, alone_, of entertaining a purpose to rob the States of their power to exclude slavery from their limits. I undertake to say, and I make the direct issue, that he did _not_ make his charge against the editor of the _Union_ alone. [Applause.] I will undertake to prove by the record here, that he made that charge against more and higher dignitaries than the editor of the Washington _Union_. I am quite aware that he was shirking and dodging around the form in which he put it, but I can make it manifest that he leveled his \"fatal blow\" against more persons than this Washington editor. Will he dodge it now by alleging that I am trying to defend Mr. Buchanan against the charge? Not at all. Am I not making the same charge myself? [Laughter and applause.] I am trying to show that you, Judge Douglas, are a witness on my side. [Renewed Laughter.] I am not defending Buchanan, and I will tell Judge Douglas that in my opinion, when he made that charge, he had an eye farther north than he was to-day. He was then fighting against people who called _him_ a Black Republican and an Abolitionist. It is mixed all through his speech, and it is tolerably manifest that his eye was a great deal farther north than it is to-day. [Cheers and laughter.] The Judge says that though he made this charge, Toombs got up and declared there was not a man in the United States, except the editor of the _Union_, who was in favor of the doctrines put forth in that article. And thereupon, I understand that the Judge withdrew the charge. Although he had taken extracts from the newspaper, and then from the Lecompton Constitution, to show the existence of a conspiracy to bring about a \"fatal blow,\" by which the States were to be deprived of the right of excluding slavery, it all went to pot as soon as Toombs got up and told him it was not true. [Laughter.] It reminds me of the story that John Phoenix, the California railroad surveyor, tells. He says they started out from the Plaza to the Mission of Dolores. They had two ways of determining distances. One was by a chain and pins taken over the ground. The other was by a \"go-it-ometer''-an invention of his own-a three-legged instrument, with which he computed a series of triangles between the points. At night he turned to the chain-man to ascertain what distance they had come, and found that by some mistake he had merely dragged the chain over the ground without keeping any record. By the \"go-it-ometer\" he found he had made ten miles. Being skeptical about this, he asked a drayman who was passing how far it was to the plaza. The drayman replied it was just half a mile, and the surveyor put it down in his book-just as Judge Douglas says, after he had made his calculations and computations, he took Toombs' statement. [Great laughter.] I have no doubt that after Judge Douglas had made his charge, he was as easily satisfied about its truth as the surveyor was of the drayman's statement of the distance to the plaza. [Renewed laughter.] Yet it is a fact that the man who put forth all that matter which Douglas deemed a \"fatal blow\" at State sovereignty, was elected by the Democrats as public printer.\n\nNow, gentlemen, you may take Judge Douglas's speech of March 22d, 1858, beginning about the middle of page 21, and reading to the bottom of page 24, and you will find the evidence on which I say that he did not make his charge against the editor of the _Union_ alone. I cannot stop to read it, but I will give it to the reporters. Judge Douglas said:\n\n\"Mr. President, you here find several distinct propositions advanced boldly by the Washington _Union_ editorially and apparently _authoritatively_, and every man who questions any of them is denounced as an Abolitionist, a Freesoiler, a fanatic. The propositions are, first, that the primary object of all government at its original institution is the protection of persons and property; second, that the Constitution of the United States declares that the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States; and that, therefore, thirdly, all State laws, whether organic or otherwise, which prohibit the citizens of one State from settling in another with their slave property, and especially declaring it forfeited, are direct violations of the original intention of the Government and Constitution of the United States; and fourth, that the emancipation of the slaves of the Northern States was a gross outrage on the rights of property, inasmuch as it was involuntarily done on the part of the owner.\"\n\n\"Remember that this article was published in the _Union_ on the 17th of November, and on the 18th appeared the first article giving the adhesion of the _Union_ to the Lecompton Constitution. It was in these words:\n\n\" KANSAS AND HER CONSTITUTION.-The vexed question is settled. The problem is solved. The dead point of danger is passed. All serious trouble to Kansas affairs is over and gone'-\n\n\"And a column, nearly, of the same sort. Then, when you come to look into the Lecompton Constitution, you find the same doctrine incorporated in it which was put forth editorially in the _Union_. What is it?\n\n\" ARTICLE 7, _Section_ 1. The right of property is before and higher than any constitutional sanction; and the right of the owner of a slave to such slave and its increase is the same and as invariable as the right of the owner of any property whatever.'\n\n\"Then in the schedule is a provision that the Constitution may be amended after 1864 by a two-thirds vote.\n\n\" But no alteration shall be made to affect the right of property in the ownership of slaves.'\n\n\"It will be seen by these clauses in the Lecompton Constitution that they are identical in spirit with this _authoritative_ article in the Washington _Union_ of the day previous to its indorsement of this Constitution.\n\n\"When I saw that article in the _Union_ of the 17th of November, followed by the glorification of the Lecompton Constitution on the 18th of November, and this clause in the Constitution asserting the doctrine that a State has no right to prohibit slavery within its limits, I saw that there was a _fatal blow_ being struck at the sovereignty of the States of this Union.\"\n\nHere he says, \"Mr. President, you here find several distinct propositions advanced boldly, and apparently _authoritatively_.\" By whose authority, Judge Douglas? [Great cheers and laughter.] Again, he says in another place, \"It will be seen by these clauses in the Lecompton Constitution, that they are identical in spirit with this _authoritative_ article.\" _By whose authority_? [Renewed cheers.] Who do you mean to say authorized the publication of these articles? He knows that the Washington _Union_ is considered the organ of the Administration. _I_ demand of Judge Douglas _by whose authority_ he meant to say those articles were published, if not by the authority of the President of the United States and his Cabinet? I defy him to show whom he referred to, if not to these high functionaries in the Federal Government. More than this, he says the articles in that paper and the provisions of the Lecompton Constitution are \"identical,\" and being identical, he argues that the authors are co-operating and conspiring together. He does not use the word \"conspiring,\" but what other construction can you put upon it? He winds up with this:\n\n\"When I saw that article in the _Union_ of the 17th of November, followed by the glorification of the Lecompton Constitution on the 18th of November, and this clause in the Constitution asserting the doctrine that a State has no right to prohibit slavery within its limits, I saw that there was a _fatal blow_ being struck at the sovereignty of the States of this Union.\"\n\nI ask him if all this fuss was made over the editor of this newspaper. [Laughter.] It would be a terribly \"_fatal_ blow\" indeed which a single man could strike, when no President, no Cabinet officer, no member of Congress, was giving strength and efficiency to the moment. Out of respect to Judge Douglas's good sense I must believe he didn't manufacture his idea of the \"fatal\" character of that blow out of such a miserable scapegrace as he represents that editor to be. But the Judge's eye is farther south now. [Laughter and cheers.] Then, it was very peculiarly and decidedly north. His hope rested on the idea of visiting the great \"Black Republican\" party, and making it the tail of his new kite. [Great laughter.] He knows he was then expecting from day to day to turn Republican and place himself at the head [of] our organization. He has found that these despised \"Black Republicans\" estimate him by a standard which he has taught them none too well. Hence he is crawling back into his old camp, and you will find him eventually installed in full fellowship among those whom he was then battling, and with whom he now pretends to be at such fearful variance. [Loud applause and cries of \"go on, go on.\"] I cannot, gentlemen, my time has expired."

        "full_text_segment": "**Mr. Douglas' Speech**\n\nLadies and Gentlemen-The silence with which you have listened to Mr. Lincoln during his hour is creditable to this vast audience, composed of men of various political parties. Nothing is more honorable to any large mass of people assembled for the purpose of a fair discussion, than that kind and respectful attention that is yielded not only to your political friends, but to those who are opposed to you in politics.\n\nI am glad that at last I have brought Mr. Lincoln to the conclusion that he had better define his position on certain political questions to which I called his attention at Ottawa. He there showed no disposition, no inclination, to answer them. I did not present idle questions for him to answer merely for my gratification. I laid the foundation for those interrogatories by showing that they constituted the platform of the party whose nominee he is for the Senate. I did not presume that I had the right to catechise him as I saw proper, unless I showed that his party, or a majority of it, stood upon the platform and were in favor of the propositions upon which my questions were based. I desired simply to know, inasmuch as he had been nominated as the first, last, and only choice of his party, whether he concurred in the platform which that party had adopted for its government. In a few moments I will proceed to review the answers which he has given to these interrogatories; but in order to relieve his anxiety I will first respond to these which he has presented to me. Mark you, he has not presented interrogatories which have ever received the sanction of the party with which I am acting, and hence he has no other foundation for them than his own curiosity.(\"That's a fact.\")\n\nFirst, he desires to know if the people of Kansas shall form a Constitution by means entirely proper and unobjectionable and ask admission into the Union as a State, before they have the requisite population for a member of Congress, whether I will vote for that admission. Well, now, I regret exceedingly that he did not answer that interrogatory himself before he put it to me, in order that we might understand, and not be left to infer, on which side he is. (Good, good.) Mr. Trumbull, during the last session of Congress, voted from the beginning to the end against the admission of Oregon, although a free State, because she had not the requisite population for a member of Congress. (That's it.) Mr. Trumbull would not consent, under any circumstances, to let a State, free or slave, come into the Union until it had the requisite population. As Mr. Trumbull is in the field, fighting for Mr. Lincoln, I would like to have Mr. Lincoln answer his own question and tell me whether he is fighting Trumbull on that issue or not. (Good, put it to him, and cheers.) But I will answer his question. In reference to Kansas, it is my opinion, that as she has population enough to constitute a slave State, she has people enough for a free State. (Cheers.) I will not make Kansas an exceptional case to the other States of the Union. (Sound, and hear, hear.) I hold it to be a sound rule of universal application to require a Territory to contain the requisite population for a member of Congress, before it is admitted as a State into the Union. I made that proposition in the Senate in 1856, and I renewed it during the last session, in a bill providing that no Territory of the United States should form a Constitution and apply for admission until it had the requisite population. On another occasion I proposed that neither Kansas, or any other Territory, should be admitted until it had the requisite population. Congress did not adopt any of my propositions containing this general rule, but did make an exception of Kansas. I will stand by that exception. (Cheers.) Either Kansas must come in as a free State, with whatever population she may have, or the rule must be applied to all the other Territories alike. (Cheers.) I therefore answer at once, that it having been decided that Kansas has people enough for a slave State, I hold that she has enough for a free State. (\"Good,\" and applause.) I hope Mr. Lincoln is satisfied with my answer; (\"he ought to be,\" and cheers,) and now I would like to get his answer to his own interrogatory-whether or not he will vote to admit Kansas before she has the requisite population. (\"Hit himi again.\") I want to know whether he will vote to admit Oregon before that Territory has the requisite population. Mr. Trumbull will not, and the same reason that commits Mr. Trumbull against the admission of Oregon, commits him against Kansas, even if she should apply for admission as a free State. (\"You've got him,\" and cheers.) If there is any sincerity, any truth, in the argument of Mr. Trumbull in the Senate, against the admission of Oregon because she had not 93,420 people, although her population was larger than that of Kansas, he stands pledged against the admission of both Oregon and Kansas until they have 93,420 inhabitants. I would like Mr. Lincoln to answer this question. I would like him to take his own medicine. (Laughter.) If he differs with Mr. Trumbull, let him answer his argument against the admission of Oregon, instead of poking questions at me. (\"Right, good, good,\" laughter and cheers.)\n\nThe next question propounded to me by Mr. Lincoln is, can the people of a Territory in any lawful way, against the wishes of any citizen of the United States, exclude slavery from their limits prior to the formation of a State Constitution? I answer emphatically, as Mr. Lincoln has heard me answer a hundred times from every stump in Illinois, that in my opinion the people of a Territory can, by lawful means, exclude slavery from their limits prior to the formation of a State Constitution. Mr. Lincoln knew that I had answered that question over and over again. He heard me argue the Nebraska bill on that principle all over the State in 1854, in 1855, and in 1856, and he has no excuse for pretending to be in doubt as to my position on that question. It matters not what way the Supreme Court may hereafter decide as to the abstract question whether slavery may or may not go into a Territory under the Constitution, the people have the lawful means to introduce it or exclude it as they please, for the reason that slavery cannot exist a day or an hour anywhere, unless it is supported by local police regulations. (Right, right.) Those police regulations can only be established by the local legislature, and if the people are opposed to slavery they will elect representatives to that body who will by unfriendly legislation effectually prevent the introduction of it into their midst. If, on the contrary, they are for it, their legislation will favor its extension. Hence, no matter what the decision of the Supreme Court may be on that abstract question, still the right of the people to make a slave Territory or a free Territory is perfect and complete under the Nebraska bill. I hope Mr. Lincoln deems my answer satisfactory on that point.\n\n[Deacon Bross spoke.]\n\nIn this connection, I will notice the charge which he has introduced in relation to Mr. Chase's amendment. I thought that I had chased that amendment out of Mr. Lincoln's brain at Ottawa; (laughter) but it seems that still haunts his imagination, and he is not yet satisfied. I had supposed that he would be ashamed to press that question further. He is a lawyer, and has been a member of Congress, and has occupied his time and amused you by telling you about parliamentary proceedings. He ought to have known better than to try to palm off his miserable impositions upon this intelligent audience. (\"Good,\" and cheers.) The Nebraska bill provided that the legislative power, and authority of the said Territory, should extend to all rightful subjects of legislation consistent with the organic act and the Constitution of the United States. It did not make any exception as to slavery, but gave all the power that it was possible for Congress to give, without violating the Constitution to the Territorial Legislature, with no exception or limitation on the subject of slavery at all. The language of that bill which I have quoted, gave the full power and the full authority over the subject of slavery, affirmatively and negatively, to introduce it or exclude it, so far as the Constitution of the United States would permit. What more could Mr. Chase give by his amendment? Nothing. He offered his amendment for the identical purpose for which Mr. Lincoln is using it, to enable demagogues in the country to try and deceive the people. (\"Good, hit him again,\" and cheers.)\n\n[Deacon Bross spoke.]\n\nHis amendment was to this effect. It provided that the Legislature should have the power to exclude slavery: and General Cass suggested, \"why not give the power to introduce as well as exclude?\" The answer was, they have the power already in the bill to do both. Chase was afraid his amendment would be adopted if he put the alternative proposition and so make it fair both ways, but would not yield. He offered it for the purpose of having it rejected. He offered it, as he has himself avowed over and over again, simply to make capital out of it for the stump. He expected that it would be capital for small politicians in the country, and that they would make an effort to deceive the people with it, and he was not mistaken, for Lincoln is carrying out the plan admirably. (\"Good, good.\") Lincoln knows that the Nebraska bill, without Chase's amendment, gave all the power which the Constitution would permit. Could Congress confer any more? (\"No, no.\") Could Congress go beyond the Constitution of the country? We gave all a full grant, with no exception in regard to slavery one way or the other. We left that question as we left all others, to be decided by the people for themselves, just as they pleased. I will not occupy my time on this question. I have argued it before all over Illinois. I have argued it in this beautiful city of Freeport; I have argued it in the North, the South, the East, and the West, avowing the same sentiments and the same principles. I have not been afraid to avow my sentiments up here for fear I would be trotted down into Egypt. (Cheers and laughter.)\n\nThe third question which Mr. Lincoln presented is, if the Supreme Court of the United States shall decide that a State of this Union cannot exclude slavery from its own limits, will I submit to it? I am amazed that Lincoln should ask such a question. [\"A school boy knows better.\"] Yes, a school-boy does know better. Mr. Lincoln's object is to cast an imputation upon the Supreme Court. He knows that there never was but one man in America, claiming any degree of intelligence or decency, who ever for a moment pretended such a thing. It is true that the Washington _Union_, in an article published on the 17th of last December, did put forth that doctrine, and I denounced the article on the floor of the Senate, in a speech which Mr. Lincoln now pretends was against the President. The _Union_ had claimed that slavery had a right to go into the free States, and that any provision in the Constitution or laws of the free States to the contrary were null and void. I denounced it in the Senate, as I said before, and I was the first man who did. Lincoln's friends, Trumbull, and Seward, and Hale, and Wilson, land the whole Black Republican side of the Senate, were silent.They left it to me to denounce it. (Cheers.) And what was the reply made to me on that occasion? Mr. Toombs, of Georgia, got up and undertook to lecture me on the ground that I ought not to have deemed the article worthy of notice, and ought not to have replied to it; that there was not one man, woman or child south of the Potomac, in any slave State, who did not repudiate any such pretension. Mr. Lincoln knows that that reply was made on the spot, and yet now he asks this question. He might as well ask me, suppose Mr. Lincoln should steal a horse, would I sanction it; (laughter) and it would be as genteel in me to ask him, in the event he stole a horse, what ought to be done with him. He casts an imputation upon the Supreme Court of the United States, by supposing that they would violate the Constitution of the United States. I tell him that such a thing is not possible. (Cheers.) It would be an act of moral treason that no man on the bench could ever descend to. Mr. Lincoln himself would never in his partisan feelings so far forget what was right as to be guilty of such an act. (\"Good, good.\")\n\nThe fourth question of Mr. Lincoln is, are you in favor of acquiring additional territory, in disregard as to how such acquisition may affect the Union on the slavery questions? This question is very ingeniously and cunningly put.\n\n[Deacon Bross here spoke, _sotto voce_, - the reporter understanding him to say, \"Now we've got him.\"]\n\nThe Black Republican creed lays it down expressly, that under no circumstances shall we acquire any more territory unless slavery is first prohibited in the country. I ask Mr. Lincoln whether he is in favor of that proposition. Are you (addressing Mr. Lincoln) opposed to the acquisition of any more territory, under any circumstances, unless slavery is prohibited in it? That he does not like to answer. When I ask him whether he stands up to that article in the platform of his party, he turns, Yankee-fashion, and without answering it, asks me whether I am in favor of acquiring territory without regard to how it may affect the Union on the slavery question. (Good.) I answer that whenever it becomes necessary, in our growth and progress, to acquire more territory, that I am in favor of it, without reference to the question of slavery, and when we have acquired it, I will leave the people free to do as they please, either to make it slave or free territory, as they prefer. [Here Deacon Bross spoke, the reporter believes that he said, \"That's bold.\" It was said solemnly.] It is idle to tell me or you that we have territory enough. Our fathers supposed that we had enough when our territory extended to the Mississippi river, but a few years' growth and expansion satisfied them that we needed more, and the Louisiana territory, from the West branch of the Mississippi to the British possessions, was acquired. Then we acquired Oregon, then California and New Mexico. We have enough now for the present, but this is a young and a growing nation. It swarms as often as a hive of bees, and as new swarms are turned out each year, there must be hives in which they can gather and make their honey. (Good.) In less than fifteen years, if the same progress that has distinguished this country for the last fifteen years continues, every foot of vacant land between this and the Pacific ocean, owned by the United States, will be occupied.Will you not continue to increase at the end of fifteen years as well as now? I tell you, increase, and multiply, and expand, is the law of this nation's existence. (Good.) You cannot limit this great Republic by mere boundary lines, saying, \"thus far shalt thou go, and no further.\" Any one of you gentlemen might as well say to a son twelve years old that he is big enough, and must not grow any larger, and in order to prevent his growth put a hoop around him to keep him to his present size. What would be the result? Either the hoop must burst and be rent asunder, or the child must die. So it would be with this great nation. With our natural increase, growing with a rapidity unknown in any other part of the globe, with the tide of emigration that is fleeing from despotism in the old world to seek refuge in our own, there is a constant torrent pouring into this country that requires more land, more territory upon which to settle, and just as fast as our interests and our destiny require additional territory in the North, in the South, or on the Islands of the ocean, I am for it, and when we acquire it, will leave the people, according to the Nebraska bill, free to do as they please on the subject of slavery and every other question. (Good, good, hurra for Douglas.)\n\nI trust now that Mr. Lincoln will deem himself answered on his four points. He racked his brain so much in devising these four questions that he exhausted himself, and had not strength enough to invent the others. (Laughter.) As soon as he is able to hold a council with his advisers, Lovejoy, Farnsworth, and Fred Douglass, he will frame and propound others. [Good, good, &c. Renewed laughter, in which Mr. Lincoln feebly joined, saying that he hoped with their aid to get seven questions, the number asked him by Judge Douglas, and so make _conclusions_ even.] You Black Republicans who say good, I have no doubt think that they are all good men. (White, white.) I have reason to recollect that some people in this country think that Fred Douglass is a very good man. The last time I came here to make a speech, while talking from the stand to you, people of Freeport, as I am doing to-day, I saw a carriage, and a magnificent one it was, drive up and take a position on the outside of the crowd; a beautiful young lady was sitting on the box-seat, whilst Fred Douglass and her mother reclined inside, and the owner of the carriage acted as driver. (Laughter, cheers, cries of right, what have you to say against it, &c.) I saw this in your own town. (\"What of it.\") All I have to say of it is this, that if you, Black Republicans, think that the negro ought to be on a social equality with your wives and daughters, and ride in a carriage with your wife, whilst you drive the team, you have perfect right to do so. I am told that one of Fred Douglass' kinsmen, another rich black negro, is now traveling in this part of the State making speeches for his friend Lincoln as the champion of black men. (\"White men, white men,\" and \"what have you to say against it?\" That's right,&c.) All I have to say on that subject is, that those of you who believe that the negro is your equal and ought to be on an equality with you socially, politically, and legally, have a right to entertain those opinions, and of course will vote for Mr. Lincoln. (\"Down with the negro,\" no, no, &c.)\n\nI have a word to say on Mr. Lincoln's answer to the interrogatories contained in my speech at Ottawa, and which he has pretended to reply to here to-day. Mr. Lincoln makes a great parade of the fact that I quoted a platform as having been adopted by the Black Republican party at Springfield in 1854, which, it turns out, was adopted at another place. Mr. Lincoln loses sight of the thing itself in his ecstacies over the mistake I made in stating the place where it was done. He thinks that that platform was not adopted on the right \"spot.\"\n\nWhen I put the direct questions to Mr. Lincoln to ascertain whether he now stands pledged to that creed-to the unconditional repeal of the Fugitive Slave law, a refusal to admit any more slave States into the Union even if the people want them, a determination to apply the Wilmot Proviso, not only to all the territory we now have, but all that we may hereafter acquire, he refused to answer, and his followers say, in excuse, that the resolutions upon which I based my interrogatories were not adopted at the \"_right spot._\" (Laughter and applause.) Lincoln and his political friends are great on \"_spots_.\" (Renewed laughter.) In Congress, as a representative of this State, he declared the Mexican war to be unjust and infamous, and would not support it, or acknowledge his own country to be right in the contest, because he said that American blood was not shed on American soil in the \"_right spot._\" (Lay on to him.) And now he cannot answer the questions I put to him at Ottawa because the resolutions I read were not adopted at the \"_right spot_.\" It may be possible that I was led into an error as to the _spot_ on which the resolutions I then read were proclaimed, but I was not, and am not in error as to the fact of their forming the basis of the creed of the Republican party when that party was first organized. [Cheers.] I will state to you the evidence I had, and upon which I relied for my statement that the resolutions in question were adopted at Springfield on the 5th of October, 1854. Although I was aware that such resolutions had been passed in this district, and nearly all the northern Congressional Districts and County Conventions, I had not noticed whether or not they had been adopted by any State Convention. In 1856, a debate arose in Congress between Major Thomas L. Harris, of the Springfield District, and Mr. Norton, of the Joliet District, on political matters connected with our State, in the course of which, Major Harris quoted those resolutions as having been passed by the first Republican State Convention that ever assembled in Illinois. I knew that Major Harris was remarkable for his accuracy, that he was a very conscientious and sincere man, and I also noticed that Norton did not question the accuracy of this statement.I therefore took it for granted that it was so, and the other day when I concluded to use the resolutions at Ottawa, I wrote to Charles H. Lanphier, editor of the _State Register_, at Springfield, calling his attention to them, telling him that I had been informed that Major Harris was lying sick at Springfield, and desiring him to call upon him and ascertain all the facts concerning the resolutions, the time and the place where they were adopted. In reply, Mr. Lanphier sent me two copies of his paper, which I have here. The first is a copy of the _State Register_, published at Springfield, Mr. Lincoln's own town, on the 16th of October 1854, only eleven days after the adjournment of the Convention, from which I desire to read the following:\n\n\"During the late discussions in this city, Lincoln made a speech, to which Judge Douglas replied. In Lincoln's speech he took the broad ground that, according to the Declaration of Independence, the whites and blacks are equal. From this he drew the conclusion, which he several times repeated, that the white man had no right to pass laws for the government of the black man without the nigger's consent. This speech of Lincoln's was heard and applauded by all the Abolitionists assembled in Springfield. So soon as Mr. Lincoln was done speaking, Mr. Codding arose and requested all the delegates to the Black Republican Convention to withdraw into the Senate chamber. They did so, and after long deliberation, they laid down the following Abolition platform as the platform on which they stood. We call the particular attention of all our readers to it.\"\n\nThen follows the identical platform, word for word, which I read at Ottawa. (Cheers.) Now, that was published in Mr. Lincoln's own town, eleven days after the Convention was held, and it has remained on record up to this day never contradicted.\n\nWhen I quoted the resolutions at Ottawa and questioned Mr. Lincoln in relation to them, he said that his name was on the committee that reported them, but he did not serve, nor did he think he served, because he was, or thought he was, in Tazewell county at the time the Convention was in session. He did not deny that the resolutions were passed by the Springfield Convention. He did not know better, and evidently thought that they were, but afterward his friends declared that they had discovered that they varied in some respects from the resolutions passed by that Convention. I have shown you that I had good evidence for believing that the resolutions had been passed at Springfield. Mr. Lincoln ought to have known better; but not a word is said about his ignorance on the subject, whilst I, notwithstanding the circumstances, am accused of forgery.\n\nNow, I will show you that if I have made a mistake as to the place where these resolutions were adopted-and when I get down to Springfield I will investigate the matter and see whether or not I have-that the principles they enunciate were adopted as the Black Republican platform (white, white,) in the various counties and Congressional Districts throughout the north end of the State in 1854. This platform was adopted in nearly every county that gave a Black Republican majority for the Legislature in that year, and here is a man (pointing to Mr. Denio, who sat on the stand near Deacon Bross) who knows as well as any living man that it was the creed of the Black Republican party at that time. I would be willing to call Denio as a witness, or any other honest man belonging to that party. I will now read the resolutions adopted at the Rockford Convention on the 30th of August, 1854, which nominated Washburne for Congress. You elected him on the following platform:\n\n_Resolved_, That the continued and increasing aggressions of slavery in our country are destructive of the best rights of a free people, and that such aggressions cannot be successfully resisted without the united political action of all good men.\n\n_Resolved_, That the citizens of the United States hold in their hands peaceful, constitutional and efficient remedy against the encroachments of the slave power, the ballot-box, and, if that remedy is boldly and wisely applied, the principles of liberty and eternal justice will be established.\n\n_Resolved_, That we accept this issue forced upon us by the slave power, and, in defense of freedom, will co-operate and be known as Republicans, pledged to the accomplishment of the following purposes:\n\nTo bring the Administration of the Government back to the control of first principles; to restore Kansas and Nebraska to the position of free Territories; to repeal and entirely abrogate the Fugitive Slave law; to restrict slavery to those States in which it exists; to prohibit the admission of any more slave States into the Union; to exclude slavery from all the Territories over which the General Government has exclusive jurisdiction, and to resist the acquisition of any more Territories unless the introduction of slavery therein forever shall have been prohibited.\n\n_Resolved_, That in furtherance of these principles we will use such constitutional and lawful means as shall seem best adapted to their accomplishment, and that we will support no man for office under the General or State Government who is not positively committed to the support of these principles, and whose personal character and conduct is not a guaranty that he is reliable and shall abjure all party allegiance and ties.\n\n_Resolved_, That we cordially invite persons of all former political parties whatever in favor of the object expressed in the above resolutions to unite with us in carrying them into effect.\n\n[Senator Douglas was frequently interrupted in reading these resolutions by loud cries of \"Good,good,\" \"that's the doctrine,\" and vociferous applause.]\n\nWell, you think that is a very good platform, do you not? (\"Yes, yes, all right,\" and cheers.) If you do, if you approve it now, and think it is all right, you will not join with those men who say that I libel you by calling these your principles, will you? (\"Good, good, hit him again,\" and great laughter and cheers.) Now, Mr. Lincoln complains; Mr. Lincoln charges that I did you and him injustice by saying that this was the platform of your party. (Renewed laughter.) I am told that Washburne made a speech in Galena last night, in which he abused me awfully for bringing to light this platform, on which he was elected to Congress. He thought that you had forgotten it, as he and Mr. Lincoln desire to. (Laughter.) He did not deny but that you had adopted it, and that he had subscribed to and was pledged by it, but he did not think it was fair to call it up and remind the people that it was their platform.\n\n[Here Deacon Bross spoke.]\n\nBut I am glad to find you are more honest in your abolitionism than your leaders, by avowing that it is your platform, and right in your opinion. (Laughter, \"you have them, good, good.\")\n\nIn the adoption of that platform, you not only declared that you would resist the admission of any more slave States, and work for the repeal of the Fugitive Slave law, but you pledged yourselves not to vote for any man for State or Federal offices who was not committed to these principles. You were thus committed. Similar resolutions to those were adopted in your county Convention here, and now with your admissions that they are your platform and embody your sentiments now as they did then, what do you think of Mr. Lincoln, your candidate for the U. S. Senate, who is attempting to dodge the responsibility of this platform, because it was not adopted in the right spot. I thought that it was adopted in Springfield, but it turns out it was not, that it was adopted at Rockford, and in the various counties which comprise this Congressional District. When I get into the next district, I will show that the same platform was adopted there, and so on through the State, until I nail the responsibility of it upon the back of the Black Republican party throughout the State. (\"White, white,\" three cheers for Douglas.)\n\nA voice- \"Couldn't you modify and call it brown?\" (laughter)\n\nMr. Douglas-Not a bit. I thought that you were becoming a little brown when your members in Congress voted for the Crittenden-Montgomery bill, but since you have backed out from that position and gone back to Abolitionism, you are black and not brown. (Shouts of laughter, and a voice, \"Can't you ask him another question.\")\n\nGentlemen, I have shown you what your platform was in 1854.You still adhere to it. The same platform was adopted by nearly all the counties where the Black Republican party had a majority in 1854. I wish now to call your attention to the action of your representatives in the Legislature when they assembled together at Springfield. In the first place, you must remember that this was the organization of a new party. It is so declared in the resolutions themselves, which say that you are going to dissolve all old party ties and call the new party Republican. The old Whig party was to have its throat cut from ear to ear, and the Democratic party was to be annihilated and blotted out of existence, whilst in lieu of these parties the Black Republican party was to be organized on this Abolition platform. You know who the chief leaders were in breaking up and destroying these two great parties. Lincoln on the one hand and Trumbull on the other, being disappointed politicians, and having retired or been driven to obscurity by an outraged constituency because of their political sins, formed a scheme to abolitionize the two parties and lead the old line Whigs and old line Democrats captive, bound hand and foot, into the Abolition camp. Giddings, Chase, Fred Douglass and Lovejoy were here to christen them whenever they were brought in. Lincoln went to work to dissolve the old line Whig party. Clay was dead, and although the sod was not yet green on his grave, this man undertook to bring into disrepute those great Compromise measures of 1850, with which Clay and Webster were identified. Up to 1854 the old Whig party and the Democratic party had stood on a common platform so far as this slavery question was concerned. You Whigs and we Democrats differed about the bank, the tariff, distribution, the specie circular and the sub-treasury, but we agreed on this slavery question and the true mode of preserving the peace and harmony of the Union. The Compromise measures of 1850 were introduced by Clay, were defended by Webster, and supported by Cass, and were approved by Fillmore, and sanctioned by the National men of both parties. They constituted a common plank upon which both Whigs and Democrats stood. In 1852 the Whig party, in its last National Convention at Baltimore, indorsed and approved these measures of Clay, and so did the National Convention of the Democratic party, held that same year. Thus the old line Whigs and the old line Democrats stood pledged to the great principle of self-government, which guaranties to the people of each Territory the right to decide the slavery question for themselves. In 1854, after the death of Clay and Webster, Mr. Lincoln, on the part of the Whigs, undertook to Abolitionize the Whig party, by dissolving it, transferring the members into the Abolition camp and making them train under Giddings, Fred Douglass, Lovejoy, Chase, Farnsworth, and other Abolition leaders. Trumbull undertook to dissolve the Democratic party by taking old Democrats into the Abolition camp. Mr. Lincoln was aided in his efforts by many leading Whigs throughout the State. Your member of Congress, Mr. Washburne, being one of the most active. Trumbull was aided by many renegades from the Democratic party, among whom were John Wentworth, Tom Turner, and others, with whom you are familiar.\n\n[Mr. Turner, who was one of the moderators, here interposed and said that he had drawn the resolutions which Senator Douglas had read.]\n\nMr. Douglas-Yes, and Turner says that he drew these resolutions. [\"Hurra for Turner, \" \"Hurra for Douglas.\"] That is right, give Turner cheers for drawing the resolutions if you approve them. If he drew those resolutions he will not deny that they are the creed of the Black Republican party.\n\nMr. Turner-\" They are our creed exactly.\"\n\nMr. Douglas-And yet Lincoln denies that he stands on them. Mr. Turner says that the creed of the Black Republican party is the admission of no more slave States, and yet Mr. Lincoln declares that he would not like to be placed in a position where he would have to vote for them. All I have to say to friend Lincoln is, that I do not think there is much danger of his being placed in such a position. As Mr. Lincoln would be very sorry to be placed in such an embarrassing position as to be obliged to vote on the admission of any more slave States, I propose, out of mere kindness, to relieve him from any such necessity.\n\nWhen the bargain between Lincoln and Trumbull was completed for Abolitionizing the Whig and Democratic parties, they \"spread\" over the State, Lincoln still pretending to be an old line Whig, in order to \"rope in\" the Whigs, and Trumbull pretending to be as good a Democrat as he ever was, in order to coax the Democrats over into the Abolition ranks. They played the part that \"decoy ducks\" play down on the Potomac river. In that part of the country they make artificial ducks and put them on the water in places where the wild ducks are to be found, for the purpose of decoying them. Well, Lincoln and Trumbull played the part of these \"decoy ducks\" and deceived enough old line Whigs and old line Democrats to elect a Black Republican Legislature. When that Legislature met, the first thing it did was to elect as Speaker of the House, the very man who is now boasting that he wrote the Abolition platform on which Lincoln will not stand. I want to know of Mr. Turner whether or not, when he was elected, he was a good embodiment of Republican principles?\n\nMr. Turner-\" I hope I was then and am now.\"\n\nMr. Douglas-He swears that he hopes he was then and is now. He wrote that Black Republican platform, and is satisfied with it now. I admire and acknowledge Turner's honesty. Every man of you know that what he says about these resolutions being the platform of the Black Republican party is true, and you also know that each one of these men who are shuffling and trying to deny it are only trying to cheat the people out of their votes for the purpose of deceiving them still more after the election. I propose to trace this thing a little further, in order that you can see what additional evidence there is to fasten this revolutionary platform upon the Black Republican party. When the Legislature assembled, there was an United States Senator to elect in the place of Gen. Shields, and before they proceeded to ballot, Lovejoy insisted on laying down certain principles by which to govern the party. It has been published to the world and satisfactorily proven that there was, at the time the alliance was made between Trumbull and Lincoln to Abolitionize the two parties, an agreement that Lincoln should take Shields's place in the United States Senate, and Trumbull should have mine so soon as they could conveniently get rid of me. When Lincoln was beaten for Shields's place, in a manner I will refer to in a few minutes, he felt very sore and restive; his friends grumbled, and some of them came out and charged that the most infamous treachery had been practiced against him; that the bargain was that Lincoln was to have had Shields's place, and Trumbull was to have waited for mine, but that Trumbull having the control of a few Abolitionized Democrats, he prevented them from voting for Lincoln, thus keeping him within a few votes of an election until he succeeded in forcing the party to drop him and elect Trumbull. Well, Trumbull having cheated Lincoln, his friends made a fuss, and in order to keep them and Lincoln quiet, the party were obliged to come forward, in advance, at the last State election, and make a pledge that they would go for Lincoln and nobody else. Lincoln could not be silenced in any other way.\n\nNow, there are a great many Black Republicans of you who do not know this thing was done. [\"White, white,\" and great clamor.] I wish to remind you that while Mr. Lincoln was speaking there was not a Democrat vulgar and blackguard enough to interrupt him. But I know that the shoe is pinching you. I am clinching Lincoln now, and you are scared to death for the result. I have seen this thing before. I have seen men make appointments for joint discussions, and the moment their man has been heard, try to interrupt and prevent a fair hearing of the other side. I have seen your mobs before, and defy your wrath. [Tremendous applause.] My friends, do not cheer, for I need my whole time. The object of the opposition is to occupy my attention in order to prevent me from giving the whole evidence and nailing this double dealing on the Black Republican party. As I have before said, Lovejoy demanded a declaration of principles on the part of the Black Republicans of the Legislature before going into an election for United States Senator. He offered the following preamble and resolutions which I hold in my hand:\n\nWHEREAS, Human slavery is a violation of the principles of natural and revealed rights; and whereas, the fathers of the Revolution, fully imbued with the spirit of these principles, declared freedom to be the inalienable birthright of all men; and whereas, the preamble to the Constitution of the United States avers that that instrument was ordained to establish justice, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity; and whereas, in furtherance of the above principles, slavery was forever prohibited in the old North-west Territory, and more recently in all that Territory lying west and north of the State of Missouri, by the act of the Federal Government; and whereas, the repeal of the prohibition last referred to, was contrary to the wishes of the people of Illinois, a violation of an implied compact, long deemed sacred by the citizens of the United States, and a wide departure from the uniform action of the General Government in relation to the extension of slavery; therefore,\n\n_Resolved, by the House of Representatives, the Senate concurring therein_, That our Senators in Congress be instructed, and our Representatives requested to introduce, if not otherwise introduced, and to vote for a bill to restore such prohibition to the aforesaid Territories, and also to extend a similar prohibition to all territory which now belongs to the United States, or which may hereafter come under their jurisdiction.\n\n_Resolved_, That our Senators in Congress be instructed, and our Representatives requested, to vote against the admission of any State into the Union, the Constitution of which does not prohibit slavery, whether the territory out of which such State may have been formed shall have been acquired by conquest, treaty, purchase, or from original territory of the United States.\n\n_Resolved,_ That our Senators in Congress be instructed, and our Representatives requested, to introduce and vote for a bill to repeal an act entitled \"an act respecting fugitives from justice and persons escaping from the service of their masters;\" and, failing in that, for such a modification of it as shall secure the right of _habeas corpus_ and trial by jury before the regularly-constituted authorities of the State, to all persons claimed as owing service or labor.\n\n(Cries of \"good,\" \"good,\" and cheers.) Yes, you say \"good,\" \"good,\" and I have no doubt you think so. Those resolutions were introduced by Mr. Lovejoy immediately preceding the election of Senator. They declared first, that the Wilmot Proviso must be applied to all territory north of 36 deg. 30 min. Secondly, that it must be applied to all territory south of 36 deg. 30 min. Thirdly, that it must be applied to all the territory now owned by the United States, and finally, that it must be applied to all territory hereafter to be acquired by the United States. The next resolution declares that no more slave States shall be admitted into this Union under any circumstances whatever, no matter whether they are formed out of territory now owned by us or that we may hereafter acquire, by treaty, by Congress, or in any manner whatever. The next resolution demands the unconditional repeal of the Fugitive Slave law, although its unconditional repeal would leave no provision for carrying out that clause of the Constitution of the United States which guaranties the surrender of fugitives. If they could not get an unconditional repeal, they demanded that that law should be so modified as to make it as nearly useless as possible. Now, I want to show you who voted for these resolutions. When the vote was taken on the first resolution it was decided in the affirmative-yeas 41, nays 32. You will find that this is a strict party vote, between the Democrats on the one hand, and the Black Republicans on the other. [Cries of \"White, white,\" and clamor.] I know your name, and always call things by their right name. The point I wish to call your attention to, is this: that these resolutions were adopted on the 7th day of February, and that on the 8th they went into an election for a United States Senator, and that day every man who voted for these resolutions, with but two exceptions, voted for Lincoln for the United States Senate. [\"Give us their names.\"] I will read the names over to you if you want them, but I believe your object is to occupy my time.\n\nOn the next resolution the vote stood-yeas 33, nays 40, and on the third resolution-yeas 35, nays 47. I wish to impress it upon you, that every man who voted for those resolutions, with but two exceptions, voted on the next day for Lincoln for U. S. Senator. Bear in mind that the members who thus voted for Lincoln were elected to the Legislature pledged to vote for no man for office under the State or Federal Government who was not committed to this Black Republican platform. They were all so pledged. Mr. Turner, who stands by me, and who then represented you, and who says that he wrote those resolutions, voted for Lincoln, when he was pledged not to do so unless Lincoln was in favor of those resolutions. I now ask Mr. Turner [turning to Mr. Turner], did you violate your pledge in voting for Mr. Lincoln, or did he commit himself to your platform before you cast your vote for him?\n\nI could go through the whole list of names here and show you that all the Black Republicans in the Legislature, who voted for Mr. Lincoln, had voted on the day previous for these resolutions. For instance, here are the names of Sargent and Little of Jo Daviess and Carroll, Thomas J. Turner of Stephenson, Lawrence of Boone and McHenry, Swan of Lake, Pinckney of Ogle county, and Lyman of Winnebago. Thus you see every member from your Congressional District voted for Mr. Lincoln, and they were pledged not to vote for him unless he was committed to the doctrine of no more slave States, the prohibition of slavery in the Territories, and the repeal of the Fugitive Slave law. Mr. Lincoln tells you today that he is not pledged to any such doctrine. Either Mr. Lincoln was then committed to those propositions, or Mr. Turner violated his pledges to you when he voted for him. Either Lincoln was pledged to each one of those propositions, or else every Black Republican Representative from this Congressional District violated his pledge of honor to his constituents by voting for him. I ask you which horn of the dilemma will you take? Will you hold Lincoln up to the platform of his party, or will you accuse every Representative you had in the Legislature of violating his pledge of honor to his constituents? There is no escape for you. Either Mr. Lincoln was committed to those propositions, or your members violated their faith. Take either horn of the dilemma you choose. There is no dodging the question; I want Lincoln's answer. He says he was not pledged to repeal the Fugitive Slave law, that he does not quite like to do it; he will not introduce a law to repeal it, but thinks there ought to be some law; he does not tell what it ought to be; upon the whole, he is altogether undecided, and don't know what to think or do. That is the substance of his answer upon the repeal of the Fugitive Slave law. I put the question to him distinctly, whether he indorsed that part of the Black Republican platform which calls for the entire abrogation and repeal of the Fugitive Slave law. He answers no! that he does not indorse that, but he does not tell what he is for, or what he will vote for. His answer is, in fact, no answer at all. Why cannot he speak out and say what he is for and what he will do?\n\nIn regard to there being no more slave States, he is not pledged to that. He would not like, he says, to be put in a position where he would have to vote one way or another upon that question. I pray you, do not put him in a position that would embarrass him so much. Gentlemen, if he goes to the Senate, he may be put in that position, and then which way will he vote?\n\n[A Voice-''How will you vote?\"]\n\nMr. Douglas-I will vote for the admission of just such a State as by the form of their Constitution the people show they want; if they want slavery, they shall have it; if they prohibit slavery it shall be prohibited. They can form their institutions to please themselves, subject only to the Constitution; and I for one stand ready to receive them into the Union. Why cannot your Black Republican candidates talk out as plain as that when they are questioned?\n\nI do not want to cheat any man out of his vote. No man is deceived in regard to my principles if I have the power to express myself in terms explicit enough to convey my ideas.\n\nMr. Lincoln made a speech when he was nominated for the United States Senate which covers all these Abolition platforms. He there lays down a proposition so broad in its abolitionism as to cover the whole ground.\n\n\"In my opinion it [the slavery agitation] will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed. 'A house divided against itself cannot stand.' I believe this Government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the house to fall-but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or all the other. Either the opponents of Slavery will arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction, or its advocates will push it forward till it shall become alike lawful in all the States-old as well as new, North as well as South.\"\n\nThere you find that Mr. Lincoln lays down the doctrine that this Union cannot endure divided as our fathers made it, with free and slave States. He says they must all become one thing, or all the other; that they must all be free or all slave, or else the Union cannot continue to exist. It being his opinion that to admit any more slave States, to continue to divide the Union into free and slave States, will dissolve it. I want to know of Mr. Lincoln whether he will vote for the admission of another slave State.\n\nHe tells you the Union cannot exist unless the States are all free or all slave; he tells you that he is opposed to making them all slave, and hence he is for making them all free, in order that the Union may exist; and yet he will not say that he will not vote against another slave State, knowing that the Union must be dissolved if he votes for it. I ask you if that is fair dealing? The true intent and inevitable conclusion to be drawn from his first Springfield speech is, that he is opposed to the admission of any more slave States under any circumstance. If he is so opposed, why not say so? If he believes this Union cannot endure divided into free and slave States, that they must all become free in order to save the Union, he is bound as an honest man, to vote against any more slave States. If he believes it he is bound to do it. Show me that it is my duty in order to save the Union to do a particular act, and I will do it if the Constitution does not prohibit it. (Applause.) I am not for the dissolution of the Union under any circumstances. (Renewed applause.) I will pursue no course of conduct that will give just cause for the dissolution of the Union. The hope of the friends of freedom throughout the world rests upon the perpetuity of this Union. The down-trodden and oppressed people who are suffering under European despotism all look with hope and anxiety to the American Union as the only resting place and permanent home of freedom and self-government.\n\nMr. Lincoln says that he believes that this Union cannot continue to endure with slave States in it, and yet he will not tell you distinctly whether he will vote for or against the admission of any more slave States, but says he would not like to be put to the test. (Laughter.) I do not think he will be put to the test. (Renewed laughter.) I do not think that the people of Illinois desire a man to represent them who would not like to be put to the test on the performance of a high constitutional duty. (Cries of good.) I will retire in shame from the Senate of the United States when I am not willing to be put to the test in the performance of my duty. I have been put to severe tests. (That is so.) I have stood by my principles in fair weather and in foul, in the sunshine and in the rain. I have defended the great principles of self-government here among you when Northern sentiment ran in a torrent against me, (A VOICE,-that is so,) and I have defended that same great principle when Southern sentiment came down like an avalanche upon me. I was not afraid of any test they put to me. I knew I was right-I knew my principles were sound-I knew that the people would see in the end that I had done right, and I knew that the God of Heaven would smile upon me if I was faithful in the performance of my duty. (Cries of good, cheers, and laughter.)\n\nMr. Lincoln makes a charge of corruption against the Supreme Court of the United States, and two Presidents of the United States, and attempts to bolster it up by saying that I did the same against the Washington _Union_. Suppose I did make that charge of corruption against the Washington _Union_, when it was true, does that justify him in making a false charge against me and others? That is the question I would put. He says that at the time the Nebraska bill was introduced, and before it was passed, there was a conspiracy between the Judges of the Supreme Court, President Pierce, President Buchanan and myself by that bill, and the decision of the court to break down the barrier and establish slavery all over the Union. Does he not know that that charge is historically false as against President Buchanan? He knows that Mr. Buchanan was at that time in England, representing this country with distinguished ability at the Court of St. James, that he was there for a long time before, and did not return for a year or more after. He knows that to be true, and that fact proves his charge to be false as against Mr. Buchanan. (Cheers.) Then again, I wish to call his attention to the fact that at the time the Nebraska bill was passed, the Dred Scott case was not before the Supreme Court at all; it was not upon the docket of the Supreme Court; it had not been brought there, and the Judges in all probability knew nothing of it. Thus the history of the country proves the charge to be false as against them. As to President Pierce, his high character as a man of integrity and honor is enough to vindicate him from such a charge, (laughter and applause,) and as to myself, I pronounce the charge an infamous lie, whenever and wherever made, and by whomsoever made. I am willing that Mr. Lincoln should go and rake up every public act of mine, every measure I have introduced, report I have made, speech delivered, and criticise them, but when he charges upon me a corrupt conspiracy for the purpose of perverting the institutions of the country, I brand it as it deserves. I say the history of the country proves it to be false, and that it could not have been possible at the time. But now he tries to protect himself in this charge, because I made a charge against the Washington _Union_. My speech in the Senate against the Washington _Union_ was made because it advocated a revolutionary doctrine, by declaring that the free States had not the right to prohibit slavery within their own limits. Because I made that charge against the Washington _Union_, Mr. Lincoln says it was a charge against Mr. Buchanan. Suppose it was; is Mr. Lincoln the peculiar defender of Mr. Buchanan? Is he so interested in the Federal Administration, and so bound to it, that he must jump to the rescue and defend it from every attack that I may make against it? (Great laughter and cheers.) I understand the whole thing. The Washington _Union_, under that most corrupt of all men, Cornelius Wendell, is advocating Mr. Lincoln's claim to the Senate. Wendell was the printer of the last Black Republican House of Representatives; he was a candidate before the present Democratic House, but was ignominiously kicked out, and then he took the money which he had made out of the public printing by means of the Black Republicans, bought the Washington _Union_, and is now publishing it in the name of the Democratic party, and advocating Mr. Lincoln's election to the Senate. Mr. Lincoln therefore considers an attack upon Wendell and his corrupt gang as a personal attack upon him. (Immense cheering and laughter.) This only proves what I have charged, that there is an alliance between Lincoln and his supporters, and the Federal office-holders of this State, and Presidential aspirants out of it, to break me down at home.\n\n[A VOICE.-That is impossible, and cheering.]\n\nMr. Lincoln feels bound to come in to the rescue of the Washington _Union_. In that speech which I delivered in answer to the Washington _Union_, I made it distinctly against the _Union_, and against the _Union_ alone. I did not choose to go beyond that. If I have occasion to attack the President's conduct, I will do it in language that will not be misunderstood. When I differed with the President, I spoke out so that you all heard me. (\"That you did,\" and cheers.) That question passed away; it resulted in the triumph of my principle by allowing the people to do as they please, and there is an end of the controversy. Whenever the great principle of self-government-the right of the people to make their own Constitution, and come into the Union with slavery or without it, as they see proper, shall again arise, you will find me standing firm in defense of that principle, and fighting whoever fights it. (\"Right, right.\" \"Good, good,\" and cheers.) If Mr. Buchanan stands, as I doubt not he will, by the recommendation contained in his Message, that hereafter all State Constitutions ought to be submitted to the people before the admission of the State into the Union, he will find me standing by him firmly, shoulder to shoulder, in carrying it out. I know Mr. Lincoln's object; he wants to divide the Democratic party, in order that he may defeat me and get to the Senate.\n\nMr. Douglas' time here expired, and he stopped on the moment."

        "full_text_segment": "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN - On Saturday last, Judge Douglas and myself first met in public discussion. He spoke one hour, I an hour and a half, and he replied for half an hour. The order is now reversed. I am to speak an hour, he an hour and a half, and then I am to reply for half an hour. I propose to devote myself during the first hour to the scope of what was brought within the range of his half-hour speech at Ottawa. Of course there was brought within the scope in that half-hour's speech something of his own opening speech. In the course of that opening argument Judge Douglas proposed to me seven distinct interrogatories. In my speech of an hour and a half, I attended to some other parts of his speech, and incidentally, as I thought, answered one of the interrogatories then. I then distinctly intimated to him that I would answer the rest of his interrogatories on condition only that he should agree to answer as many for me. He made no intimation at the time of the proposition, nor did he in his reply allude at all to that suggestion of mine. I do him no injustice in saying that he occupied at least half of his reply in dealing with me as though I had _refused_ to answer his interrogatories. I now propose that I will answer any of the interrogatories, upon condition that he will answer quest ions from me not exceeding the same number. I give him an opportunity to respond. The Judge remains silent. I now say that I will answer his interrogatories, whether he answers mine or not; [applause] and that after I have done so, I shall propound mine to him. [Applause.]\n\n[Owing to the press of people against the platform, our reporter did not reach the stand until Mr. Lincoln had spoken to this point. The previous remakrs were taken by a gentleman in Freeport, who has politely furnished them to us.]\n\nI have supposed myself, since the organization of the Republican party at Bloomington, in May, 1856, bound as a party man by the platforms of the party, then and since. If in any interrogatories which I shall answer I go beyond the scope of what is within these platforms, it will be perceived that no one is responsible but myself.\n\nHaving said thus much, I will take up the Judge's interrogatories as I find them printed in the Chicago _Times_, and answer them _seriatim_. In order that there may be no mistake about it, I have copied the interrogatories in writing, and also my answers to them. The first one of these interrogatories is in these words:\n\nQuestion 1. \"I desire to know whether Lincoln to-day stands, as he did in 1854, in favor of the unconditional repeal of the Fugitive Slave law?\"\n\nAnswer. I do not now, nor ever did, stand in favor of the unconditional repeal of the Fugitive Slave law. [Cries of \"Good,\" \"Good.\"]\n\nQ. 2. \"I desire him to answer whether he stands pledged to-day, as he did in 1854, against the admission of any more slave States into the Union, even if the people want them?\"\n\nA. I do not now, or ever did, stand pledged against the admission of any more slave States into the Union.\n\nQ. 3. \"1 want to know whether he stands pledged against the admission of a new State into the Union with such a Constitution as the people of that State may see fit to make?\"\n\nA. I do not stand pledged against the admission of a new State into the Union, with such a Constitution as the people of that State may see fit to make. [Cries of \"good,\" \"good.\"]\n\nQ. 4. \"I want to know whether he stands to-day pledged to the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia?\"\n\nA. I do not stand to-day pledged to the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia.\n\nQ. 5. \"I desire him to answer whether he stands pledged to the prohibition of the slave-trade between the different States?\"\n\nA. I do not stand pledged to the prohibition of the slave-trade between the different States.\n\nQ. 6. \"I desire to know whether he stands pledged to prohibit slavery in all the Territories of the United States, North as well as South of the Missouri Compromise line?\"\n\nA. I am impliedly, if not expressly, pledged to a belief in the _right_ and _duty_ of Congress to prohibit slavery in all the United States Territories.\n\nQ. 7. \"I desire him to answer whether he is opposed to the acquisition of any new territory unless slavery is first prohibited therein?\"\n\nA. I am not generally opposed to honest acquisition of territory; and, in any given case, I would or would not oppose such acquisition, accordingly as I might think such acquisition would or would not agravate [sic] the slavery question among ourselves. [Cries of good, good.]\n\nNow, my friends, it will be perceived upon an examination of these questions and answers, that so far I have only answered that I was not _pledged_ to this, that or the other. The Judge has not framed his interrogatories to ask me anything more than this, and I have answered in strict accordance with the interrogatories, and have answered truly that I am not _pledged_ at all upon any of the points to which I have answered. But I am not disposed to hang upon the exact form of his interrogatory. I am rather disposed to take up at least some of these questions, and state what I really think upon them.\n\nAs to the first one, in regard to the Fugitive Slave law, I have never hesitated to say, and I do not now hesitate to say, that I think, under the Constitution of the United States, the people of the Southern States are entitled to a Congressional Fugitive Slave law. Having said that, I have had nothing to say in regard to the existing Fugitive Slave law, further than that I think it should have been framed so as to be free from some of the objections that pertain to it, without lessening its efficiency. And inasmuch as we are not now in an agitation in regard to an alteration or modification of that law, I would not be the man to introduce it as a new subject of agitation upon the general question of slavery.\n\nIn regard to the other question, of whether I am pledged to the admission of any more slave States into the Union, I state to you very frankly that I would be exceedingly sorry ever to be put in a position of having to pass upon that question. I should be exceedingly glad to know that there would never be another slave State admitted into the Union; but I must add, that if slavery shall be kept out of the Territories during the territorial existence of any one given Territory, and then the people shall, having a fair chance and a clear field, when they come to adopt the Constitution, do such an extraordinary thing as to adopt a slave Constitution, uninfluenced by the actual presence of the institution among them, I see no alternative, if we own the country, but to admit them into the Union. [Applause.]\n\nThe third interrogatory is answered by the answer to the second, it being, as I conceive, the same as the second.\n\nThe fourth one is in regard to the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia. In relation to that, I have my mind very distinctly made up. I should be exceedingly glad to see slavery abolished in the District of Columbia. [Cries of \"good, good.\"] I believe that Congress possesses the constitutional power to abolish it. Yet as a member of Congress, I should not with my present views, be in favor of _endeavoring_ to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, unless it would be upon these conditions: _First_, that the abolition should be gradual. _Second_, that it should be on a vote of the majority of qualified voters in the District; and _third_, that compensation should be made to unwilling owners. With these three conditions, I confess I would be exceedingly glad to see Congress abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, and, in the language of Henry Clay, \"sweep from our Capital that foul blot upon our nation.\" [Loud applause.]\n\nIn regard to the fifth interrogatory, I must say here, that as to the question of the abolition of the slave-trade between the different States, I can truly answer, as I have, that I am _pledged_ to nothing about it. It is a subject to which I have not given that mature consideration that would make me feel authorized to state a position so as to hold myself entirely bound by it. In other words, that question has never been prominently enough before me to induce me to investigate whether we really have the constitutional power to do it. I could investigate it if I had sufficient time, to bring myself to a conclusion upon that subject; but I have not done so, and I say so frankly to you here, and to Judge Douglas. I must say, however, that if I should be of opinion that Congress does possess the constitutional power to abolish the slave-trade among the different States, I should still not be in favor of the exercise of that power unless upon some conservative principle as I conceive it, akin to what I have said in relation to the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia.\n\nMy answer as to whether I desire that slavery should be prohibited in all the Territories of the United States, is full and explicit within itself, and cannot be made clearer by any comments of mine. So I suppose in regard to the question whether I am opposed to the acquisition of any more territory unless slavery is first prohibited therein, my answer is such that I could add nothing by way of illustration, or making myself better understood, than the answer which I have placed in writing.\n\nNow in all this, the Judge has me, and he has me on the record. I suppose he had flattered himself that I was really entertaining one set of opinions for one place and another set for another place -that I was afraid to say at one place what I uttered at another. What I am saying here I suppose I say to a vast audience as strongly tending to Abolitionism as any audience in the State of Illinois, and I believe I am saying that which, if it would be offensive to any persons and render them enemies to myself, would be offensive to persons in this audience.\n\nI now proceed to propound to the Judge the interrogatories, so far as I have framed them. I will bring forward a new installment when I get them ready. [Laughter.] I will bring them forward now, only reaching to number four.\n\nThe first one is:\n\nQuestion 1. If the people of Kansas shall, by means entirely unobjectionable in all other respects, adopt a State Constitution, and ask admission into the Union under it, _before_ they have the requisite number of inhabitants according to the English bill-some ninety-three thousand-will you vote to admit them? [Applause.]\n\nQ. 2. Can the people of a United States Territory, in any lawful way, against the wish of any citizen of the United States, exclude slavery from its limits prior to the formation of a State Constitution? [Renewed applause.]\n\nQ. 3. If the Supreme Court of the United States shall decide that States cannot exclude slavery from their limits, are you in favor of acquiescing in, adopting and following such decision as a rule of political action? [Loud applause.]\n\nQ. 4. Are you in favor of acquiring additional territory, in disregard of how such acquisition may affect the nation on the slavery question? [Cries of \"good,\" \"good.\"]\n\nAs introductory to these interrogatories which Judge Douglas propounded to me at Ottawa, he read a set of resolutions which he said Judge Trumbull and myself had participated in adopting, in the first Republican State Convention, held at Springfield, in October, 1854. He insisted that I and Judge Trumbull, and perhaps the entire Republican party, were responsible for the doctrines contained in the set of resolutions which he read, and I understand that it was from that set of resolutions that he deduced the interrogatories which he propounded to me, using these resolutions as a sort of authority for propounding those questions to me. Now I say here today that I do not answer his interrogatories because of their springing at all from that set of resolutions which he read. I answered them because Judge Douglas thought fit to ask them. [Applause.] I do not now, nor never did, recognize any responsibility upon myself in that set of resolutions. When I replied to him on that occasion, I assured him that I never had anything to do with them. I repeat here to-day, that I never in any possible form had anything to do with that set of resolutions. It turns out, I believe, that those resolutions were never passed in any Convention held in Springfield. [Cheers and Laughter.] It turns out that they were never passed at any Convention or any public meeting that I had any part in. I believe it turns out in addition to all this, that there was not, in the fall of 1854, any Convention holding a session in Springfield, calling itself a Republican State Convention; yet it is true there was a Convention, or assemblage of men calling themselves a Convention, at Springfield, that did pass _some_ resolutions. But so little did I really know of the proceedings of that Convention, or what set of resolutions they had passed, though having a general knowledge that there had been such an assemblage of men there, that when Judge Douglas read the resolutions, I really did not know but they had been the resolutions passed then and there. I did not question that they were the resolutions adopted. For I could not bring myself to suppose that Judge Douglas could say what he did upon this subject without _knowing_ that it was true. [Cheers and laughter.] I contented myself, on that occasion, with denying, as I truly could, all connection with them, not denying or affirming whether they were passed at Springfield. Now it turns out that he had got hold of some resolutions passed at some Convention or public meeting in Kane county. [Renewed laughter.] I wish to say here, that I don't conceive that in any fair and just mind this discovery relieves me at all. I had just as much to do with the Convention in Kane county as that at Springfield. I am just as much responsible for the resolutions at Kane county as those at Springfield, the amount of the responsibility being exactly nothing in either case; no more than there would be in regard to a set of resolutions passed in the moon. [Laughter and loud cheers.]\n\nI allude to this extraordinary matter in this canvass for some further purpose than anything yet advanced. Judge Douglas did not make his statement upon that occasion as matters that he believed to be true, but he stated them roundly as _being true_, in such form as to pledge his veracity for their truth. When the whole matter turns out as it does, and when we consider who Judge Douglas is-that he is a distinguished Senator of the United States-that he has served nearly twelve years as such-that his character is not at all limited as an ordinary Senator of the United States, but that his name has become of world-wide renown-it is _most extraordinary_ that he should so far forget all the suggestions of justice to an adversary, or of prudence to himself, as to venture upon the assertion of that which the slightest investigation would have shown him to be wholly false. [Cheers.] I can only account for his having done so upon the supposition that that evil genius which has attended him through his life, giving to him an apparent astonishing prosperity, such as to lead very many good men to doubt there being any advantage in virtue over vice - [Cheers and laughter] I say I can only account for it on the supposition that that evil genius has at last made up its mind to forsake him. [Continued cheers and laughter.]\n\nAnd I may add that another extraordinary feature of the Judge's conduct in this canvass-made more extraordinary by this incident-is, that he is in the habit, in almost all the speeches he makes, of charging falsehood upon his adversaries, myself and others. I now ask whether he is able to find in any thing that Judge Trumbull, for instance, has said, or in any thing that I have said, a justification at all compared with what we have, in this instance, for that sort of vulgarity. [Cries of \"good,\" \"good,\" \"good.\"]\n\nI have been in the habit of charging as a matter of belief on my part, that, in the introduction of the Nebraska bill into Congress, there was a conspiracy to make slavery perpetual and national. I have arranged from time to time the evidence which establishes and proves the truth of this charge. I recurred to this charge at Ottawa. I shall not now have time to dwell upon it at very great length; but, inasmuch as Judge Douglas in his reply of half an hour, made some points upon me in relation to it, I propose noticing a few of them.\n\nThe Judge insists that, in the first speech I made, in which I very distinctly made that charge, he thought for a good while I was in fun!-that I was playful-that I was not sincere about it-and that he only grew angry and somewhat excited when he found that I insisted upon it as a matter of earnestness. He says he characterized it as a falsehood as far as I implicated his _moral character_ in that transaction. Well, I did not know, till he presented that view, that I had implicated his moral character. He is very much in the habit, when he argues me up into a position I never thought of occupying, of very cosily saying he has no doubt Lincoln is \"conscientious\" in saying so. He should remember that I did not know but what _he_ was ALTOGETHER \"CONSCIENTIOUS\" in that matter. [Great Laughter.] I can conceive it possible for men to conspire to do a good thing, and I really find nothing in Judge Douglas's course or arguments that is contrary to or inconsistent with his belief of a conspiracy to nationalize and spread slavery as being a good and blessed thing, [Continued Laughter,] and so I hope he will understand that I do not at all question but that in all this matter he is entirely \"conscientious.\" [More laughter and cheers.]\n\nBut to draw your attention to one of the points I made in this case, beginning at the beginning. When the Nebraska bill was introduced, or a short time afterward, by an amendment, I believe, it was provided that it must be considered \"the true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any State or Territory, or to exclude it therefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their own domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the Constitution of the United States.\" I have called his attention to the fact that when he and some others began arguing that they were giving an increased degree of liberty to the people in the Territories over and above what they formerly had on the question of slavery, a question was raised whether the law was enacted to give such unconditional liberty to the people, and to test the sincerity of this mode of argument, Mr. Chase, of Ohio, introduced an amendment, in which he made the law-if the amendment were adopted -expressly declare that the people of the Territory should have the power to exclude slavery if they saw fit. I have asked attention also to the fact that Judge Douglas and those who acted with him, voted that amendment down, notwithstanding it expressed exactly the thing they said was the true intent and meaning of the law. I have called attention to the fact that in subsequent times, a decision of the Supreme Court has been made, in which it has been declared that a Territorial Legislature has no constitutional right to exclude slavery. And I have argued and said that for men who did intend that the people of the Territory should have the right to exclude slavery absolutely and unconditionally, the voting down of Chase's amendment is wholly inexplicable. It is a puzzle-a riddle. But I have said that with men who did look forward to such a decision, or who had it in contemplation, that such a decision of the Supreme Court would or might be made, the voting down of that amendment would be perfectly rational and intelligible. It would keep Congress from coming in collision with the decision when it was made. Any body can conceive that if there was an intention or expectation that such a decision was to follow, it would not be a very desirable party attitude to get into for the Supreme Court-all or nearly all its members belonging to the same party-to decide one way, when the party in Congress had decided the other way. Hence it would be very rational for men expecting such a decision, to keep the niche in that law clear for it. After pointing this out, I tell Judge Douglas that it looks to me as though here was the reason why Chase's amendment was voted down. I tell him that as he did it, and knows why he did it, if it was done for a reason different from this, _he knows what that reason was, and can tell us what it was_. I tell him, also, it will be vastly more satisfactory to the country for him to give some other plausible, intelligible reason _why_ it was voted down than to stand upon his dignity and call people liars. [Loud cheers.] Well, on Saturday he did make his answer, and what do you think it was? He says if I had only taken upon myself to tell the whole truth about that amendment of Chase's, no explanation would have been necessary on his part-or words to that effect. Now, I say here, that I am quite unconscious of having suppressed any thing material to the case, and I am very frank to admit if there is any sound reason other than that which appeared to me material, it is quite fair for him to present it. What reason does he propose? That when Chase came forward with his amendment expressly authorizing the people to exclude slavery from the limits of every Territory, Gen. Cass proposed to Chase, if he (Chase) would add to his amendment that the people should have the power to _introduce_ or exclude, they would let it go. (This is substantially all of his reply.) And because Chase would not do that, they voted his amendment down. Well, it turns out, I believe, upon examination, that General Cass took some part in the little running debate upon that amendment, and then ran away _and did not vote on it at all_. [Laughter.] Is not that the fact? So confident, as I think, was General Cass that there was a snake somewhere about, he chose to run away from the whole thing.This is an inference I draw from the fact that, though he took part in the debate, his name does not appear in the ayes and noes. But does Judge Douglas's reply amount to a satisfactory answer? [Cries of \"yes,\" \"yes,\" and \"no, \" \"no.\"] There is some little difference of opinion here. [Laughter.] But I ask attention to a few more views bearing on the question of whether it amounts to a satisfactory answer. The men who were determined that that amendment should not get into the bill and spoil the place where the Dred Scott decision was to come in, sought an excuse to get rid of it somewhere. One of these ways-one of these excuses-was to ask Chase to add to his proposed amendment a provision that the people might _introduce_ slavery if they wanted to. They very well knew Chase would do no such thing-that Mr. Chase was one of the men differing from them on the broad principle of his insisting that freedom was _better_ than slavery-a man who would not consent to enact a law, penned with his own hand, by which he was made to recognize slavery on the one hand and liberty on the other as _precisely equal_; and when they insisted on his doing this, they very well knew they insisted on that which he would not for a moment think of doing, and that they were only bluffing him. I believe (I have not, since he made his answer, had a chance to examine the journals or _Congressional Globe_, and therefore speak from memory) -I believe the state of the bill at that time, according to parliamentary rules, was such that no member could propose an additional amendment to Chase's amendment. I rather think this is the truth-the Judge shakes his head. Very well. I would like to know, then, _if they wanted Chase's amendment fixed over, why somebody else could not have offered to do it?_ If they wanted it amended, why did they not offer the amendment? Why did they stand there taunting and quibbling at Chase? Why did they not _put it in themselves?_ But to put it on the other ground; suppose that there was such an amendment offered, and Chase's was an amendment to an amendment; until one is disposed of by parliamentary law, you cannot pile another on. Then all these gentlemen had to do was to vote Chase's on, and then in the amended form in which the whole stood, add their own amendment to it if they wanted to put it in that shape. This was all they were obliged to do, and the ayes and noes show that there were 36 who voted it down, against 10 who voted in favor of it. The 36 held entire sway and control. They could in some form or other have put that bill in the exact shape they wanted. If there was a rule preventing their amending it at the time, they could pass that, and then Chase's amendment being merged, put it in the shape they wanted. They did not choose to do so, but they went into a quibble with Chase to get him to add what they knew he would not add, and because he would not, they stand upon that flimsy pretext for voting down what they argued was the meaning and intent of their own bill. They left room thereby for this Dred Scott decision, which goes very far to make slavery national throughout the United States.\n\nI pass one or two points I have because my time will very soon expire, but I must be allowed to say that Judge Douglas recurs again, as he did upon one or two other occasions, [to] the enormity of Lincoln-an insignificant individual like Lincoln-upon his _ipse dixit_ charging a conspiracy upon a large number of members of Congress, the Supreme Court and two Presidents, to nationalize slavery. I want to say that, in the first place, I have made no charge of this sort upon my _ipse dixit_. I have only arrayed the evidence tending to prove it, and presented it to the understanding of others, saying what I think it proves, but giving you the means of judging whether it proves it or not. This is precisely what I have done. I have not placed it upon my _ipse dixit_ at all. On this occasion, I wish to recall his attention to a piece of evidence which I brought forward at Ottawa on Saturday, showing that he had made substantially the _same charge_ against substantially the _same persons_, excluding his dear self from the category. I ask him to give some attention to the evidence which I brought forward, that he himself had discovered a \"fatal blow being struck\" against the right of the people to exclude slavery from their limits, which fatal blow he assumed as in evidence in an article in the Washington _Union_, published \"by authority.\" I ask by whose authority? He discovers a similar or identical provision in the Lecompton Constitution. Made by whom? The framers of that Constitution. Advocated by whom? By all the members of the party in the nation, who advocated the introduction of Kansas into the Union under the Lecompton Constitution.\n\nI have asked his attention to the evidence that he arrayed to prove that such a fatal blow was being struck, and to the facts which he brought forward in support of that charge-being identical with the one which he thinks so villainous in me. He pointed it not at a newspaper editor merely, but at the President and his Cabinet and the members of Congress advocating the Lecompton Constitution and those framing that instrument. I must again be permitted to remind him, that although my _ipse dixit_ may not be as great as his, yet it somewhat reduces the force of his calling my attention to the _enormity_ of my making a like charge against him. [Loud applause.]\n\nGo on, Judge Douglas."

I answer emphatically, as Mr. Lincoln has heard me answer a hundred times from every stump in Illinois, that in my opinion the people of a Territory can, by lawful means, exclude slavery from their limits prior to the formation of a State Constitution. Mr. Lincoln knew that I had answered that question over and over again. He heard me argue the Nebraska bill on that principle all over the State in 1854, in 1855, and in 1856, and he has no excuse for pretending to be in doubt as to my position on that question. It matters not what way the Supreme Court may hereafter decide as to the abstract question whether slavery may or may not go into a Territory under the Constitution, the people have the lawful means to introduce it or exclude it as they please, for the reason that slavery cannot exist a day or an hour anywhere, unless it is supported by local police regulations. (Right, right.) Those police regulations can only be established by the local legislature, and if the people are opposed to slavery they will elect representatives to that body who will by unfriendly legislation effectually prevent the introduction of it into their midst. If, on the contrary, they are for it, their legislation will favor its extension. Hence, no matter what the decision of the Supreme Court may be on that abstract question, still the right of the people to make a slave Territory or a free Territory is perfect and complete under the Nebraska bill. I hope Mr. Lincoln deems my answer satisfactory on that point."

    "full_text": "It was a cloudy, cool, and damp day. Special trains brought people from Galena, Chicago, Rockford, and other cities in northern Illinois. Estimates as high as 15,000 were reported in various newspaper accounts.\n\nLincoln answered the seven questions Douglas posed at Ottawa and then asked four of his own. Douglas' response became known as the Freeport Doctrine which had ramifications at the 1860 Democratic National Convention.\n\nSource: Neely, Mark E. Jr. 1982. _The Abraham Lincoln Encyclopedia_. New York: Da Capo Press, Inc.\n\nFull text of the debate follows.\n\n**Mr. Lincoln's Speech**\n\nMr. Lincoln was introduced by Hon. Thomas J. Turner, and was greeted with loud cheers. When the applause had subsided, he said:\n\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN - On Saturday last, Judge Douglas and myself first met in public discussion. He spoke one hour, I an hour and a half, and he replied for half an hour. The order is now reversed. I am to speak an hour, he an hour and a half, and then I am to reply for half an hour. I propose to devote myself during the first hour to the scope of what was brought within the range of his half-hour speech at Ottawa. Of course there was brought within the scope in that half-hour's speech something of his own opening speech. In the course of that opening argument Judge Douglas proposed to me seven distinct interrogatories. In my speech of an hour and a half, I attended to some other parts of his speech, and incidentally, as I thought, answered one of the interrogatories then. I then distinctly intimated to him that I would answer the rest of his interrogatories on condition only that he should agree to answer as many for me. He made no intimation at the time of the proposition, nor did he in his reply allude at all to that suggestion of mine. I do him no injustice in saying that he occupied at least half of his reply in dealing with me as though I had _refused_ to answer his interrogatories. I now propose that I will answer any of the interrogatories, upon condition that he will answer quest ions from me not exceeding the same number. I give him an opportunity to respond. The Judge remains silent. I now say that I will answer his interrogatories, whether he answers mine or not; [applause] and that after I have done so, I shall propound mine to him. [Applause.]\n\n[Owing to the press of people against the platform, our reporter did not reach the stand until Mr. Lincoln had spoken to this point. The previous remakrs were taken by a gentleman in Freeport, who has politely furnished them to us.]\n\nI have supposed myself, since the organization of the Republican party at Bloomington, in May, 1856, bound as a party man by the platforms of the party, then and since. If in any interrogatories which I shall answer I go beyond the scope of what is within these platforms, it will be perceived that no one is responsible but myself.\n\nHaving said thus much, I will take up the Judge's interrogatories as I find them printed in the Chicago _Times_, and answer them _seriatim_. In order that there may be no mistake about it, I have copied the interrogatories in writing, and also my answers to them. The first one of these interrogatories is in these words:\n\nQuestion 1. \"I desire to know whether Lincoln to-day stands, as he did in 1854, in favor of the unconditional repeal of the Fugitive Slave law?\"\n\nAnswer. I do not now, nor ever did, stand in favor of the unconditional repeal of the Fugitive Slave law. [Cries of \"Good,\" \"Good.\"]\n\nQ. 2. \"I desire him to answer whether he stands pledged to-day, as he did in 1854, against the admission of any more slave States into the Union, even if the people want them?\"\n\nA. I do not now, or ever did, stand pledged against the admission of any more slave States into the Union.\n\nQ. 3. \"1 want to know whether he stands pledged against the admission of a new State into the Union with such a Constitution as the people of that State may see fit to make?\"\n\nA. I do not stand pledged against the admission of a new State into the Union, with such a Constitution as the people of that State may see fit to make. [Cries of \"good,\" \"good.\"]\n\nQ. 4. \"I want to know whether he stands to-day pledged to the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia?\"\n\nA. I do not stand to-day pledged to the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia.\n\nQ. 5. \"I desire him to answer whether he stands pledged to the prohibition of the slave-trade between the different States?\"\n\nA. I do not stand pledged to the prohibition of the slave-trade between the different States.\n\nQ. 6. \"I desire to know whether he stands pledged to prohibit slavery in all the Territories of the United States, North as well as South of the Missouri Compromise line?\"\n\nA. I am impliedly, if not expressly, pledged to a belief in the _right_ and _duty_ of Congress to prohibit slavery in all the United States Territories.\n\nQ. 7. \"I desire him to answer whether he is opposed to the acquisition of any new territory unless slavery is first prohibited therein?\"\n\nA. I am not generally opposed to honest acquisition of territory; and, in any given case, I would or would not oppose such acquisition, accordingly as I might think such acquisition would or would not agravate [sic] the slavery question among ourselves. [Cries of good, good.]\n\nNow, my friends, it will be perceived upon an examination of these questions and answers, that so far I have only answered that I was not _pledged_ to this, that or the other. The Judge has not framed his interrogatories to ask me anything more than this, and I have answered in strict accordance with the interrogatories, and have answered truly that I am not _pledged_ at all upon any of the points to which I have answered. But I am not disposed to hang upon the exact form of his interrogatory. I am rather disposed to take up at least some of these questions, and state what I really think upon them.\n\nAs to the first one, in regard to the Fugitive Slave law, I have never hesitated to say, and I do not now hesitate to say, that I think, under the Constitution of the United States, the people of the Southern States are entitled to a Congressional Fugitive Slave law. Having said that, I have had nothing to say in regard to the existing Fugitive Slave law, further than that I think it should have been framed so as to be free from some of the objections that pertain to it, without lessening its efficiency. And inasmuch as we are not now in an agitation in regard to an alteration or modification of that law, I would not be the man to introduce it as a new subject of agitation upon the general question of slavery.\n\nIn regard to the other question, of whether I am pledged to the admission of any more slave States into the Union, I state to you very frankly that I would be exceedingly sorry ever to be put in a position of having to pass upon that question. I should be exceedingly glad to know that there would never be another slave State admitted into the Union; but I must add, that if slavery shall be kept out of the Territories during the territorial existence of any one given Territory, and then the people shall, having a fair chance and a clear field, when they come to adopt the Constitution, do such an extraordinary thing as to adopt a slave Constitution, uninfluenced by the actual presence of the institution among them, I see no alternative, if we own the country, but to admit them into the Union. [Applause.]\n\nThe third interrogatory is answered by the answer to the second, it being, as I conceive, the same as the second.\n\nThe fourth one is in regard to the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia. In relation to that, I have my mind very distinctly made up. I should be exceedingly glad to see slavery abolished in the District of Columbia. [Cries of \"good, good.\"] I believe that Congress possesses the constitutional power to abolish it. Yet as a member of Congress, I should not with my present views, be in favor of _endeavoring_ to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, unless it would be upon these conditions: _First_, that the abolition should be gradual. _Second_, that it should be on a vote of the majority of qualified voters in the District; and _third_, that compensation should be made to unwilling owners. With these three conditions, I confess I would be exceedingly glad to see Congress abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, and, in the language of Henry Clay, \"sweep from our Capital that foul blot upon our nation.\" [Loud applause.]\n\nIn regard to the fifth interrogatory, I must say here, that as to the question of the abolition of the slave-trade between the different States, I can truly answer, as I have, that I am _pledged_ to nothing about it. It is a subject to which I have not given that mature consideration that would make me feel authorized to state a position so as to hold myself entirely bound by it. In other words, that question has never been prominently enough before me to induce me to investigate whether we really have the constitutional power to do it. I could investigate it if I had sufficient time, to bring myself to a conclusion upon that subject; but I have not done so, and I say so frankly to you here, and to Judge Douglas. I must say, however, that if I should be of opinion that Congress does possess the constitutional power to abolish the slave-trade among the different States, I should still not be in favor of the exercise of that power unless upon some conservative principle as I conceive it, akin to what I have said in relation to the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia.\n\nMy answer as to whether I desire that slavery should be prohibited in all the Territories of the United States, is full and explicit within itself, and cannot be made clearer by any comments of mine. So I suppose in regard to the question whether I am opposed to the acquisition of any more territory unless slavery is first prohibited therein, my answer is such that I could add nothing by way of illustration, or making myself better understood, than the answer which I have placed in writing.\n\nNow in all this, the Judge has me, and he has me on the record. I suppose he had flattered himself that I was really entertaining one set of opinions for one place and another set for another place -that I was afraid to say at one place what I uttered at another. What I am saying here I suppose I say to a vast audience as strongly tending to Abolitionism as any audience in the State of Illinois, and I believe I am saying that which, if it would be offensive to any persons and render them enemies to myself, would be offensive to persons in this audience.\n\nI now proceed to propound to the Judge the interrogatories, so far as I have framed them. I will bring forward a new installment when I get them ready. [Laughter.] I will bring them forward now, only reaching to number four.\n\nThe first one is:\n\nQuestion 1. If the people of Kansas shall, by means entirely unobjectionable in all other respects, adopt a State Constitution, and ask admission into the Union under it, _before_ they have the requisite number of inhabitants according to the English bill-some ninety-three thousand-will you vote to admit them? [Applause.]\n\nQ. 2. Can the people of a United States Territory, in any lawful way, against the wish of any citizen of the United States, exclude slavery from its limits prior to the formation of a State Constitution? [Renewed applause.]\n\nQ. 3. If the Supreme Court of the United States shall decide that States cannot exclude slavery from their limits, are you in favor of acquiescing in, adopting and following such decision as a rule of political action? [Loud applause.]\n\nQ. 4. Are you in favor of acquiring additional territory, in disregard of how such acquisition may affect the nation on the slavery question? [Cries of \"good,\" \"good.\"]\n\nAs introductory to these interrogatories which Judge Douglas propounded to me at Ottawa, he read a set of resolutions which he said Judge Trumbull and myself had participated in adopting, in the first Republican State Convention, held at Springfield, in October, 1854. He insisted that I and Judge Trumbull, and perhaps the entire Republican party, were responsible for the doctrines contained in the set of resolutions which he read, and I understand that it was from that set of resolutions that he deduced the interrogatories which he propounded to me, using these resolutions as a sort of authority for propounding those questions to me. Now I say here today that I do not answer his interrogatories because of their springing at all from that set of resolutions which he read. I answered them because Judge Douglas thought fit to ask them. [Applause.] I do not now, nor never did, recognize any responsibility upon myself in that set of resolutions. When I replied to him on that occasion, I assured him that I never had anything to do with them. I repeat here to-day, that I never in any possible form had anything to do with that set of resolutions. It turns out, I believe, that those resolutions were never passed in any Convention held in Springfield. [Cheers and Laughter.] It turns out that they were never passed at any Convention or any public meeting that I had any part in. I believe it turns out in addition to all this, that there was not, in the fall of 1854, any Convention holding a session in Springfield, calling itself a Republican State Convention; yet it is true there was a Convention, or assemblage of men calling themselves a Convention, at Springfield, that did pass _some_ resolutions. But so little did I really know of the proceedings of that Convention, or what set of resolutions they had passed, though having a general knowledge that there had been such an assemblage of men there, that when Judge Douglas read the resolutions, I really did not know but they had been the resolutions passed then and there. I did not question that they were the resolutions adopted. For I could not bring myself to suppose that Judge Douglas could say what he did upon this subject without _knowing_ that it was true. [Cheers and laughter.] I contented myself, on that occasion, with denying, as I truly could, all connection with them, not denying or affirming whether they were passed at Springfield. Now it turns out that he had got hold of some resolutions passed at some Convention or public meeting in Kane county. [Renewed laughter.] I wish to say here, that I don't conceive that in any fair and just mind this discovery relieves me at all. I had just as much to do with the Convention in Kane county as that at Springfield. I am just as much responsible for the resolutions at Kane county as those at Springfield, the amount of the responsibility being exactly nothing in either case; no more than there would be in regard to a set of resolutions passed in the moon. [Laughter and loud cheers.]\n\nI allude to this extraordinary matter in this canvass for some further purpose than anything yet advanced. Judge Douglas did not make his statement upon that occasion as matters that he believed to be true, but he stated them roundly as _being true_, in such form as to pledge his veracity for their truth. When the whole matter turns out as it does, and when we consider who Judge Douglas is-that he is a distinguished Senator of the United States-that he has served nearly twelve years as such-that his character is not at all limited as an ordinary Senator of the United States, but that his name has become of world-wide renown-it is _most extraordinary_ that he should so far forget all the suggestions of justice to an adversary, or of prudence to himself, as to venture upon the assertion of that which the slightest investigation would have shown him to be wholly false. [Cheers.] I can only account for his having done so upon the supposition that that evil genius which has attended him through his life, giving to him an apparent astonishing prosperity, such as to lead very many good men to doubt there being any advantage in virtue over vice - [Cheers and laughter] I say I can only account for it on the supposition that that evil genius has at last made up its mind to forsake him. [Continued cheers and laughter.]\n\nAnd I may add that another extraordinary feature of the Judge's conduct in this canvass-made more extraordinary by this incident-is, that he is in the habit, in almost all the speeches he makes, of charging falsehood upon his adversaries, myself and others. I now ask whether he is able to find in any thing that Judge Trumbull, for instance, has said, or in any thing that I have said, a justification at all compared with what we have, in this instance, for that sort of vulgarity. [Cries of \"good,\" \"good,\" \"good.\"]\n\nI have been in the habit of charging as a matter of belief on my part, that, in the introduction of the Nebraska bill into Congress, there was a conspiracy to make slavery perpetual and national. I have arranged from time to time the evidence which establishes and proves the truth of this charge. I recurred to this charge at Ottawa. I shall not now have time to dwell upon it at very great length; but, inasmuch as Judge Douglas in his reply of half an hour, made some points upon me in relation to it, I propose noticing a few of them.\n\nThe Judge insists that, in the first speech I made, in which I very distinctly made that charge, he thought for a good while I was in fun!-that I was playful-that I was not sincere about it-and that he only grew angry and somewhat excited when he found that I insisted upon it as a matter of earnestness. He says he characterized it as a falsehood as far as I implicated his _moral character_ in that transaction. Well, I did not know, till he presented that view, that I had implicated his moral character. He is very much in the habit, when he argues me up into a position I never thought of occupying, of very cosily saying he has no doubt Lincoln is \"conscientious\" in saying so. He should remember that I did not know but what _he_ was ALTOGETHER \"CONSCIENTIOUS\" in that matter. [Great Laughter.] I can conceive it possible for men to conspire to do a good thing, and I really find nothing in Judge Douglas's course or arguments that is contrary to or inconsistent with his belief of a conspiracy to nationalize and spread slavery as being a good and blessed thing, [Continued Laughter,] and so I hope he will understand that I do not at all question but that in all this matter he is entirely \"conscientious.\" [More laughter and cheers.]\n\nBut to draw your attention to one of the points I made in this case, beginning at the beginning. When the Nebraska bill was introduced, or a short time afterward, by an amendment, I believe, it was provided that it must be considered \"the true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any State or Territory, or to exclude it therefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their own domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the Constitution of the United States.\" I have called his attention to the fact that when he and some others began arguing that they were giving an increased degree of liberty to the people in the Territories over and above what they formerly had on the question of slavery, a question was raised whether the law was enacted to give such unconditional liberty to the people, and to test the sincerity of this mode of argument, Mr. Chase, of Ohio, introduced an amendment, in which he made the law-if the amendment were adopted -expressly declare that the people of the Territory should have the power to exclude slavery if they saw fit. I have asked attention also to the fact that Judge Douglas and those who acted with him, voted that amendment down, notwithstanding it expressed exactly the thing they said was the true intent and meaning of the law. I have called attention to the fact that in subsequent times, a decision of the Supreme Court has been made, in which it has been declared that a Territorial Legislature has no constitutional right to exclude slavery. And I have argued and said that for men who did intend that the people of the Territory should have the right to exclude slavery absolutely and unconditionally, the voting down of Chase's amendment is wholly inexplicable. It is a puzzle-a riddle. But I have said that with men who did look forward to such a decision, or who had it in contemplation, that such a decision of the Supreme Court would or might be made, the voting down of that amendment would be perfectly rational and intelligible. It would keep Congress from coming in collision with the decision when it was made. Any body can conceive that if there was an intention or expectation that such a decision was to follow, it would not be a very desirable party attitude to get into for the Supreme Court-all or nearly all its members belonging to the same party-to decide one way, when the party in Congress had decided the other way. Hence it would be very rational for men expecting such a decision, to keep the niche in that law clear for it. After pointing this out, I tell Judge Douglas that it looks to me as though here was the reason why Chase's amendment was voted down. I tell him that as he did it, and knows why he did it, if it was done for a reason different from this, _he knows what that reason was, and can tell us what it was_. I tell him, also, it will be vastly more satisfactory to the country for him to give some other plausible, intelligible reason _why_ it was voted down than to stand upon his dignity and call people liars. [Loud cheers.] Well, on Saturday he did make his answer, and what do you think it was? He says if I had only taken upon myself to tell the whole truth about that amendment of Chase's, no explanation would have been necessary on his part-or words to that effect. Now, I say here, that I am quite unconscious of having suppressed any thing material to the case, and I am very frank to admit if there is any sound reason other than that which appeared to me material, it is quite fair for him to present it. What reason does he propose? That when Chase came forward with his amendment expressly authorizing the people to exclude slavery from the limits of every Territory, Gen. Cass proposed to Chase, if he (Chase) would add to his amendment that the people should have the power to _introduce_ or exclude, they would let it go. (This is substantially all of his reply.) And because Chase would not do that, they voted his amendment down. Well, it turns out, I believe, upon examination, that General Cass took some part in the little running debate upon that amendment, and then ran away _and did not vote on it at all_. [Laughter.] Is not that the fact? So confident, as I think, was General Cass that there was a snake somewhere about, he chose to run away from the whole thing.This is an inference I draw from the fact that, though he took part in the debate, his name does not appear in the ayes and noes. But does Judge Douglas's reply amount to a satisfactory answer? [Cries of \"yes,\" \"yes,\" and \"no, \" \"no.\"] There is some little difference of opinion here. [Laughter.] But I ask attention to a few more views bearing on the question of whether it amounts to a satisfactory answer. The men who were determined that that amendment should not get into the bill and spoil the place where the Dred Scott decision was to come in, sought an excuse to get rid of it somewhere. One of these ways-one of these excuses-was to ask Chase to add to his proposed amendment a provision that the people might _introduce_ slavery if they wanted to. They very well knew Chase would do no such thing-that Mr. Chase was one of the men differing from them on the broad principle of his insisting that freedom was _better_ than slavery-a man who would not consent to enact a law, penned with his own hand, by which he was made to recognize slavery on the one hand and liberty on the other as _precisely equal_; and when they insisted on his doing this, they very well knew they insisted on that which he would not for a moment think of doing, and that they were only bluffing him. I believe (I have not, since he made his answer, had a chance to examine the journals or _Congressional Globe_, and therefore speak from memory) -I believe the state of the bill at that time, according to parliamentary rules, was such that no member could propose an additional amendment to Chase's amendment. I rather think this is the truth-the Judge shakes his head. Very well. I would like to know, then, _if they wanted Chase's amendment fixed over, why somebody else could not have offered to do it?_ If they wanted it amended, why did they not offer the amendment? Why did they stand there taunting and quibbling at Chase? Why did they not _put it in themselves?_ But to put it on the other ground; suppose that there was such an amendment offered, and Chase's was an amendment to an amendment; until one is disposed of by parliamentary law, you cannot pile another on. Then all these gentlemen had to do was to vote Chase's on, and then in the amended form in which the whole stood, add their own amendment to it if they wanted to put it in that shape. This was all they were obliged to do, and the ayes and noes show that there were 36 who voted it down, against 10 who voted in favor of it. The 36 held entire sway and control. They could in some form or other have put that bill in the exact shape they wanted. If there was a rule preventing their amending it at the time, they could pass that, and then Chase's amendment being merged, put it in the shape they wanted. They did not choose to do so, but they went into a quibble with Chase to get him to add what they knew he would not add, and because he would not, they stand upon that flimsy pretext for voting down what they argued was the meaning and intent of their own bill. They left room thereby for this Dred Scott decision, which goes very far to make slavery national throughout the United States.\n\nI pass one or two points I have because my time will very soon expire, but I must be allowed to say that Judge Douglas recurs again, as he did upon one or two other occasions, [to] the enormity of Lincoln-an insignificant individual like Lincoln-upon his _ipse dixit_ charging a conspiracy upon a large number of members of Congress, the Supreme Court and two Presidents, to nationalize slavery. I want to say that, in the first place, I have made no charge of this sort upon my _ipse dixit_. I have only arrayed the evidence tending to prove it, and presented it to the understanding of others, saying what I think it proves, but giving you the means of judging whether it proves it or not. This is precisely what I have done. I have not placed it upon my _ipse dixit_ at all. On this occasion, I wish to recall his attention to a piece of evidence which I brought forward at Ottawa on Saturday, showing that he had made substantially the _same charge_ against substantially the _same persons_, excluding his dear self from the category. I ask him to give some attention to the evidence which I brought forward, that he himself had discovered a \"fatal blow being struck\" against the right of the people to exclude slavery from their limits, which fatal blow he assumed as in evidence in an article in the Washington _Union_, published \"by authority.\" I ask by whose authority? He discovers a similar or identical provision in the Lecompton Constitution. Made by whom? The framers of that Constitution. Advocated by whom? By all the members of the party in the nation, who advocated the introduction of Kansas into the Union under the Lecompton Constitution.\n\nI have asked his attention to the evidence that he arrayed to prove that such a fatal blow was being struck, and to the facts which he brought forward in support of that charge-being identical with the one which he thinks so villainous in me. He pointed it not at a newspaper editor merely, but at the President and his Cabinet and the members of Congress advocating the Lecompton Constitution and those framing that instrument. I must again be permitted to remind him, that although my _ipse dixit_ may not be as great as his, yet it somewhat reduces the force of his calling my attention to the _enormity_ of my making a like charge against him. [Loud applause.]\n\nGo on, Judge Douglas.\n\n**Mr. Douglas' Speech**\n\nLadies and Gentlemen-The silence with which you have listened to Mr. Lincoln during his hour is creditable to this vast audience, composed of men of various political parties. Nothing is more honorable to any large mass of people assembled for the purpose of a fair discussion, than that kind and respectful attention that is yielded not only to your political friends, but to those who are opposed to you in politics.\n\nI am glad that at last I have brought Mr. Lincoln to the conclusion that he had better define his position on certain political questions to which I called his attention at Ottawa. He there showed no disposition, no inclination, to answer them. I did not present idle questions for him to answer merely for my gratification. I laid the foundation for those interrogatories by showing that they constituted the platform of the party whose nominee he is for the Senate. I did not presume that I had the right to catechise him as I saw proper, unless I showed that his party, or a majority of it, stood upon the platform and were in favor of the propositions upon which my questions were based. I desired simply to know, inasmuch as he had been nominated as the first, last, and only choice of his party, whether he concurred in the platform which that party had adopted for its government. In a few moments I will proceed to review the answers which he has given to these interrogatories; but in order to relieve his anxiety I will first respond to these which he has presented to me. Mark you, he has not presented interrogatories which have ever received the sanction of the party with which I am acting, and hence he has no other foundation for them than his own curiosity.(\"That's a fact.\")\n\nFirst, he desires to know if the people of Kansas shall form a Constitution by means entirely proper and unobjectionable and ask admission into the Union as a State, before they have the requisite population for a member of Congress, whether I will vote for that admission. Well, now, I regret exceedingly that he did not answer that interrogatory himself before he put it to me, in order that we might understand, and not be left to infer, on which side he is. (Good, good.) Mr. Trumbull, during the last session of Congress, voted from the beginning to the end against the admission of Oregon, although a free State, because she had not the requisite population for a member of Congress. (That's it.) Mr. Trumbull would not consent, under any circumstances, to let a State, free or slave, come into the Union until it had the requisite population. As Mr. Trumbull is in the field, fighting for Mr. Lincoln, I would like to have Mr. Lincoln answer his own question and tell me whether he is fighting Trumbull on that issue or not. (Good, put it to him, and cheers.) But I will answer his question. In reference to Kansas, it is my opinion, that as she has population enough to constitute a slave State, she has people enough for a free State. (Cheers.) I will not make Kansas an exceptional case to the other States of the Union. (Sound, and hear, hear.) I hold it to be a sound rule of universal application to require a Territory to contain the requisite population for a member of Congress, before it is admitted as a State into the Union. I made that proposition in the Senate in 1856, and I renewed it during the last session, in a bill providing that no Territory of the United States should form a Constitution and apply for admission until it had the requisite population. On another occasion I proposed that neither Kansas, or any other Territory, should be admitted until it had the requisite population. Congress did not adopt any of my propositions containing this general rule, but did make an exception of Kansas. I will stand by that exception. (Cheers.) Either Kansas must come in as a free State, with whatever population she may have, or the rule must be applied to all the other Territories alike. (Cheers.) I therefore answer at once, that it having been decided that Kansas has people enough for a slave State, I hold that she has enough for a free State. (\"Good,\" and applause.) I hope Mr. Lincoln is satisfied with my answer; (\"he ought to be,\" and cheers,) and now I would like to get his answer to his own interrogatory-whether or not he will vote to admit Kansas before she has the requisite population. (\"Hit himi again.\") I want to know whether he will vote to admit Oregon before that Territory has the requisite population. Mr. Trumbull will not, and the same reason that commits Mr. Trumbull against the admission of Oregon, commits him against Kansas, even if she should apply for admission as a free State. (\"You've got him,\" and cheers.) If there is any sincerity, any truth, in the argument of Mr. Trumbull in the Senate, against the admission of Oregon because she had not 93,420 people, although her population was larger than that of Kansas, he stands pledged against the admission of both Oregon and Kansas until they have 93,420 inhabitants. I would like Mr. Lincoln to answer this question. I would like him to take his own medicine. (Laughter.) If he differs with Mr. Trumbull, let him answer his argument against the admission of Oregon, instead of poking questions at me. (\"Right, good, good,\" laughter and cheers.)\n\nThe next question propounded to me by Mr. Lincoln is, can the people of a Territory in any lawful way, against the wishes of any citizen of the United States, exclude slavery from their limits prior to the formation of a State Constitution? I answer emphatically, as Mr. Lincoln has heard me answer a hundred times from every stump in Illinois, that in my opinion the people of a Territory can, by lawful means, exclude slavery from their limits prior to the formation of a State Constitution. Mr. Lincoln knew that I had answered that question over and over again. He heard me argue the Nebraska bill on that principle all over the State in 1854, in 1855, and in 1856, and he has no excuse for pretending to be in doubt as to my position on that question. It matters not what way the Supreme Court may hereafter decide as to the abstract question whether slavery may or may not go into a Territory under the Constitution, the people have the lawful means to introduce it or exclude it as they please, for the reason that slavery cannot exist a day or an hour anywhere, unless it is supported by local police regulations. (Right, right.) Those police regulations can only be established by the local legislature, and if the people are opposed to slavery they will elect representatives to that body who will by unfriendly legislation effectually prevent the introduction of it into their midst. If, on the contrary, they are for it, their legislation will favor its extension. Hence, no matter what the decision of the Supreme Court may be on that abstract question, still the right of the people to make a slave Territory or a free Territory is perfect and complete under the Nebraska bill. I hope Mr. Lincoln deems my answer satisfactory on that point.\n\n[Deacon Bross spoke.]\n\nIn this connection, I will notice the charge which he has introduced in relation to Mr. Chase's amendment. I thought that I had chased that amendment out of Mr. Lincoln's brain at Ottawa; (laughter) but it seems that still haunts his imagination, and he is not yet satisfied. I had supposed that he would be ashamed to press that question further. He is a lawyer, and has been a member of Congress, and has occupied his time and amused you by telling you about parliamentary proceedings. He ought to have known better than to try to palm off his miserable impositions upon this intelligent audience. (\"Good,\" and cheers.) The Nebraska bill provided that the legislative power, and authority of the said Territory, should extend to all rightful subjects of legislation consistent with the organic act and the Constitution of the United States. It did not make any exception as to slavery, but gave all the power that it was possible for Congress to give, without violating the Constitution to the Territorial Legislature, with no exception or limitation on the subject of slavery at all. The language of that bill which I have quoted, gave the full power and the full authority over the subject of slavery, affirmatively and negatively, to introduce it or exclude it, so far as the Constitution of the United States would permit. What more could Mr. Chase give by his amendment? Nothing. He offered his amendment for the identical purpose for which Mr. Lincoln is using it, to enable demagogues in the country to try and deceive the people. (\"Good, hit him again,\" and cheers.)\n\n[Deacon Bross spoke.]\n\nHis amendment was to this effect. It provided that the Legislature should have the power to exclude slavery: and General Cass suggested, \"why not give the power to introduce as well as exclude?\" The answer was, they have the power already in the bill to do both. Chase was afraid his amendment would be adopted if he put the alternative proposition and so make it fair both ways, but would not yield. He offered it for the purpose of having it rejected. He offered it, as he has himself avowed over and over again, simply to make capital out of it for the stump. He expected that it would be capital for small politicians in the country, and that they would make an effort to deceive the people with it, and he was not mistaken, for Lincoln is carrying out the plan admirably. (\"Good, good.\") Lincoln knows that the Nebraska bill, without Chase's amendment, gave all the power which the Constitution would permit. Could Congress confer any more? (\"No, no.\") Could Congress go beyond the Constitution of the country? We gave all a full grant, with no exception in regard to slavery one way or the other. We left that question as we left all others, to be decided by the people for themselves, just as they pleased. I will not occupy my time on this question. I have argued it before all over Illinois. I have argued it in this beautiful city of Freeport; I have argued it in the North, the South, the East, and the West, avowing the same sentiments and the same principles. I have not been afraid to avow my sentiments up here for fear I would be trotted down into Egypt. (Cheers and laughter.)\n\nThe third question which Mr. Lincoln presented is, if the Supreme Court of the United States shall decide that a State of this Union cannot exclude slavery from its own limits, will I submit to it? I am amazed that Lincoln should ask such a question. [\"A school boy knows better.\"] Yes, a school-boy does know better. Mr. Lincoln's object is to cast an imputation upon the Supreme Court. He knows that there never was but one man in America, claiming any degree of intelligence or decency, who ever for a moment pretended such a thing. It is true that the Washington _Union_, in an article published on the 17th of last December, did put forth that doctrine, and I denounced the article on the floor of the Senate, in a speech which Mr. Lincoln now pretends was against the President. The _Union_ had claimed that slavery had a right to go into the free States, and that any provision in the Constitution or laws of the free States to the contrary were null and void. I denounced it in the Senate, as I said before, and I was the first man who did. Lincoln's friends, Trumbull, and Seward, and Hale, and Wilson, land the whole Black Republican side of the Senate, were silent.They left it to me to denounce it. (Cheers.) And what was the reply made to me on that occasion? Mr. Toombs, of Georgia, got up and undertook to lecture me on the ground that I ought not to have deemed the article worthy of notice, and ought not to have replied to it; that there was not one man, woman or child south of the Potomac, in any slave State, who did not repudiate any such pretension. Mr. Lincoln knows that that reply was made on the spot, and yet now he asks this question. He might as well ask me, suppose Mr. Lincoln should steal a horse, would I sanction it; (laughter) and it would be as genteel in me to ask him, in the event he stole a horse, what ought to be done with him. He casts an imputation upon the Supreme Court of the United States, by supposing that they would violate the Constitution of the United States. I tell him that such a thing is not possible. (Cheers.) It would be an act of moral treason that no man on the bench could ever descend to. Mr. Lincoln himself would never in his partisan feelings so far forget what was right as to be guilty of such an act. (\"Good, good.\")\n\nThe fourth question of Mr. Lincoln is, are you in favor of acquiring additional territory, in disregard as to how such acquisition may affect the Union on the slavery questions? This question is very ingeniously and cunningly put.\n\n[Deacon Bross here spoke, _sotto voce_, - the reporter understanding him to say, \"Now we've got him.\"]\n\nThe Black Republican creed lays it down expressly, that under no circumstances shall we acquire any more territory unless slavery is first prohibited in the country. I ask Mr. Lincoln whether he is in favor of that proposition. Are you (addressing Mr. Lincoln) opposed to the acquisition of any more territory, under any circumstances, unless slavery is prohibited in it? That he does not like to answer. When I ask him whether he stands up to that article in the platform of his party, he turns, Yankee-fashion, and without answering it, asks me whether I am in favor of acquiring territory without regard to how it may affect the Union on the slavery question. (Good.) I answer that whenever it becomes necessary, in our growth and progress, to acquire more territory, that I am in favor of it, without reference to the question of slavery, and when we have acquired it, I will leave the people free to do as they please, either to make it slave or free territory, as they prefer. [Here Deacon Bross spoke, the reporter believes that he said, \"That's bold.\" It was said solemnly.] It is idle to tell me or you that we have territory enough. Our fathers supposed that we had enough when our territory extended to the Mississippi river, but a few years' growth and expansion satisfied them that we needed more, and the Louisiana territory, from the West branch of the Mississippi to the British possessions, was acquired. Then we acquired Oregon, then California and New Mexico. We have enough now for the present, but this is a young and a growing nation. It swarms as often as a hive of bees, and as new swarms are turned out each year, there must be hives in which they can gather and make their honey. (Good.) In less than fifteen years, if the same progress that has distinguished this country for the last fifteen years continues, every foot of vacant land between this and the Pacific ocean, owned by the United States, will be occupied.Will you not continue to increase at the end of fifteen years as well as now? I tell you, increase, and multiply, and expand, is the law of this nation's existence. (Good.) You cannot limit this great Republic by mere boundary lines, saying, \"thus far shalt thou go, and no further.\" Any one of you gentlemen might as well say to a son twelve years old that he is big enough, and must not grow any larger, and in order to prevent his growth put a hoop around him to keep him to his present size. What would be the result? Either the hoop must burst and be rent asunder, or the child must die. So it would be with this great nation. With our natural increase, growing with a rapidity unknown in any other part of the globe, with the tide of emigration that is fleeing from despotism in the old world to seek refuge in our own, there is a constant torrent pouring into this country that requires more land, more territory upon which to settle, and just as fast as our interests and our destiny require additional territory in the North, in the South, or on the Islands of the ocean, I am for it, and when we acquire it, will leave the people, according to the Nebraska bill, free to do as they please on the subject of slavery and every other question. (Good, good, hurra for Douglas.)\n\nI trust now that Mr. Lincoln will deem himself answered on his four points. He racked his brain so much in devising these four questions that he exhausted himself, and had not strength enough to invent the others. (Laughter.) As soon as he is able to hold a council with his advisers, Lovejoy, Farnsworth, and Fred Douglass, he will frame and propound others. [Good, good, &c. Renewed laughter, in which Mr. Lincoln feebly joined, saying that he hoped with their aid to get seven questions, the number asked him by Judge Douglas, and so make _conclusions_ even.] You Black Republicans who say good, I have no doubt think that they are all good men. (White, white.) I have reason to recollect that some people in this country think that Fred Douglass is a very good man. The last time I came here to make a speech, while talking from the stand to you, people of Freeport, as I am doing to-day, I saw a carriage, and a magnificent one it was, drive up and take a position on the outside of the crowd; a beautiful young lady was sitting on the box-seat, whilst Fred Douglass and her mother reclined inside, and the owner of the carriage acted as driver. (Laughter, cheers, cries of right, what have you to say against it, &c.) I saw this in your own town. (\"What of it.\") All I have to say of it is this, that if you, Black Republicans, think that the negro ought to be on a social equality with your wives and daughters, and ride in a carriage with your wife, whilst you drive the team, you have perfect right to do so. I am told that one of Fred Douglass' kinsmen, another rich black negro, is now traveling in this part of the State making speeches for his friend Lincoln as the champion of black men. (\"White men, white men,\" and \"what have you to say against it?\" That's right,&c.) All I have to say on that subject is, that those of you who believe that the negro is your equal and ought to be on an equality with you socially, politically, and legally, have a right to entertain those opinions, and of course will vote for Mr. Lincoln. (\"Down with the negro,\" no, no, &c.)\n\nI have a word to say on Mr. Lincoln's answer to the interrogatories contained in my speech at Ottawa, and which he has pretended to reply to here to-day. Mr. Lincoln makes a great parade of the fact that I quoted a platform as having been adopted by the Black Republican party at Springfield in 1854, which, it turns out, was adopted at another place. Mr. Lincoln loses sight of the thing itself in his ecstacies over the mistake I made in stating the place where it was done. He thinks that that platform was not adopted on the right \"spot.\"\n\nWhen I put the direct questions to Mr. Lincoln to ascertain whether he now stands pledged to that creed-to the unconditional repeal of the Fugitive Slave law, a refusal to admit any more slave States into the Union even if the people want them, a determination to apply the Wilmot Proviso, not only to all the territory we now have, but all that we may hereafter acquire, he refused to answer, and his followers say, in excuse, that the resolutions upon which I based my interrogatories were not adopted at the \"_right spot._\" (Laughter and applause.) Lincoln and his political friends are great on \"_spots_.\" (Renewed laughter.) In Congress, as a representative of this State, he declared the Mexican war to be unjust and infamous, and would not support it, or acknowledge his own country to be right in the contest, because he said that American blood was not shed on American soil in the \"_right spot._\" (Lay on to him.) And now he cannot answer the questions I put to him at Ottawa because the resolutions I read were not adopted at the \"_right spot_.\" It may be possible that I was led into an error as to the _spot_ on which the resolutions I then read were proclaimed, but I was not, and am not in error as to the fact of their forming the basis of the creed of the Republican party when that party was first organized. [Cheers.] I will state to you the evidence I had, and upon which I relied for my statement that the resolutions in question were adopted at Springfield on the 5th of October, 1854. Although I was aware that such resolutions had been passed in this district, and nearly all the northern Congressional Districts and County Conventions, I had not noticed whether or not they had been adopted by any State Convention. In 1856, a debate arose in Congress between Major Thomas L. Harris, of the Springfield District, and Mr. Norton, of the Joliet District, on political matters connected with our State, in the course of which, Major Harris quoted those resolutions as having been passed by the first Republican State Convention that ever assembled in Illinois. I knew that Major Harris was remarkable for his accuracy, that he was a very conscientious and sincere man, and I also noticed that Norton did not question the accuracy of this statement.I therefore took it for granted that it was so, and the other day when I concluded to use the resolutions at Ottawa, I wrote to Charles H. Lanphier, editor of the _State Register_, at Springfield, calling his attention to them, telling him that I had been informed that Major Harris was lying sick at Springfield, and desiring him to call upon him and ascertain all the facts concerning the resolutions, the time and the place where they were adopted. In reply, Mr. Lanphier sent me two copies of his paper, which I have here. The first is a copy of the _State Register_, published at Springfield, Mr. Lincoln's own town, on the 16th of October 1854, only eleven days after the adjournment of the Convention, from which I desire to read the following:\n\n\"During the late discussions in this city, Lincoln made a speech, to which Judge Douglas replied. In Lincoln's speech he took the broad ground that, according to the Declaration of Independence, the whites and blacks are equal. From this he drew the conclusion, which he several times repeated, that the white man had no right to pass laws for the government of the black man without the nigger's consent. This speech of Lincoln's was heard and applauded by all the Abolitionists assembled in Springfield. So soon as Mr. Lincoln was done speaking, Mr. Codding arose and requested all the delegates to the Black Republican Convention to withdraw into the Senate chamber. They did so, and after long deliberation, they laid down the following Abolition platform as the platform on which they stood. We call the particular attention of all our readers to it.\"\n\nThen follows the identical platform, word for word, which I read at Ottawa. (Cheers.) Now, that was published in Mr. Lincoln's own town, eleven days after the Convention was held, and it has remained on record up to this day never contradicted.\n\nWhen I quoted the resolutions at Ottawa and questioned Mr. Lincoln in relation to them, he said that his name was on the committee that reported them, but he did not serve, nor did he think he served, because he was, or thought he was, in Tazewell county at the time the Convention was in session. He did not deny that the resolutions were passed by the Springfield Convention. He did not know better, and evidently thought that they were, but afterward his friends declared that they had discovered that they varied in some respects from the resolutions passed by that Convention. I have shown you that I had good evidence for believing that the resolutions had been passed at Springfield. Mr. Lincoln ought to have known better; but not a word is said about his ignorance on the subject, whilst I, notwithstanding the circumstances, am accused of forgery.\n\nNow, I will show you that if I have made a mistake as to the place where these resolutions were adopted-and when I get down to Springfield I will investigate the matter and see whether or not I have-that the principles they enunciate were adopted as the Black Republican platform (white, white,) in the various counties and Congressional Districts throughout the north end of the State in 1854. This platform was adopted in nearly every county that gave a Black Republican majority for the Legislature in that year, and here is a man (pointing to Mr. Denio, who sat on the stand near Deacon Bross) who knows as well as any living man that it was the creed of the Black Republican party at that time. I would be willing to call Denio as a witness, or any other honest man belonging to that party. I will now read the resolutions adopted at the Rockford Convention on the 30th of August, 1854, which nominated Washburne for Congress. You elected him on the following platform:\n\n_Resolved_, That the continued and increasing aggressions of slavery in our country are destructive of the best rights of a free people, and that such aggressions cannot be successfully resisted without the united political action of all good men.\n\n_Resolved_, That the citizens of the United States hold in their hands peaceful, constitutional and efficient remedy against the encroachments of the slave power, the ballot-box, and, if that remedy is boldly and wisely applied, the principles of liberty and eternal justice will be established.\n\n_Resolved_, That we accept this issue forced upon us by the slave power, and, in defense of freedom, will co-operate and be known as Republicans, pledged to the accomplishment of the following purposes:\n\nTo bring the Administration of the Government back to the control of first principles; to restore Kansas and Nebraska to the position of free Territories; to repeal and entirely abrogate the Fugitive Slave law; to restrict slavery to those States in which it exists; to prohibit the admission of any more slave States into the Union; to exclude slavery from all the Territories over which the General Government has exclusive jurisdiction, and to resist the acquisition of any more Territories unless the introduction of slavery therein forever shall have been prohibited.\n\n_Resolved_, That in furtherance of these principles we will use such constitutional and lawful means as shall seem best adapted to their accomplishment, and that we will support no man for office under the General or State Government who is not positively committed to the support of these principles, and whose personal character and conduct is not a guaranty that he is reliable and shall abjure all party allegiance and ties.\n\n_Resolved_, That we cordially invite persons of all former political parties whatever in favor of the object expressed in the above resolutions to unite with us in carrying them into effect.\n\n[Senator Douglas was frequently interrupted in reading these resolutions by loud cries of \"Good,good,\" \"that's the doctrine,\" and vociferous applause.]\n\nWell, you think that is a very good platform, do you not? (\"Yes, yes, all right,\" and cheers.) If you do, if you approve it now, and think it is all right, you will not join with those men who say that I libel you by calling these your principles, will you? (\"Good, good, hit him again,\" and great laughter and cheers.) Now, Mr. Lincoln complains; Mr. Lincoln charges that I did you and him injustice by saying that this was the platform of your party. (Renewed laughter.) I am told that Washburne made a speech in Galena last night, in which he abused me awfully for bringing to light this platform, on which he was elected to Congress. He thought that you had forgotten it, as he and Mr. Lincoln desire to. (Laughter.) He did not deny but that you had adopted it, and that he had subscribed to and was pledged by it, but he did not think it was fair to call it up and remind the people that it was their platform.\n\n[Here Deacon Bross spoke.]\n\nBut I am glad to find you are more honest in your abolitionism than your leaders, by avowing that it is your platform, and right in your opinion. (Laughter, \"you have them, good, good.\")\n\nIn the adoption of that platform, you not only declared that you would resist the admission of any more slave States, and work for the repeal of the Fugitive Slave law, but you pledged yourselves not to vote for any man for State or Federal offices who was not committed to these principles. You were thus committed. Similar resolutions to those were adopted in your county Convention here, and now with your admissions that they are your platform and embody your sentiments now as they did then, what do you think of Mr. Lincoln, your candidate for the U. S. Senate, who is attempting to dodge the responsibility of this platform, because it was not adopted in the right spot. I thought that it was adopted in Springfield, but it turns out it was not, that it was adopted at Rockford, and in the various counties which comprise this Congressional District. When I get into the next district, I will show that the same platform was adopted there, and so on through the State, until I nail the responsibility of it upon the back of the Black Republican party throughout the State. (\"White, white,\" three cheers for Douglas.)\n\nA voice- \"Couldn't you modify and call it brown?\" (laughter)\n\nMr. Douglas-Not a bit. I thought that you were becoming a little brown when your members in Congress voted for the Crittenden-Montgomery bill, but since you have backed out from that position and gone back to Abolitionism, you are black and not brown. (Shouts of laughter, and a voice, \"Can't you ask him another question.\")\n\nGentlemen, I have shown you what your platform was in 1854.You still adhere to it. The same platform was adopted by nearly all the counties where the Black Republican party had a majority in 1854. I wish now to call your attention to the action of your representatives in the Legislature when they assembled together at Springfield. In the first place, you must remember that this was the organization of a new party. It is so declared in the resolutions themselves, which say that you are going to dissolve all old party ties and call the new party Republican. The old Whig party was to have its throat cut from ear to ear, and the Democratic party was to be annihilated and blotted out of existence, whilst in lieu of these parties the Black Republican party was to be organized on this Abolition platform. You know who the chief leaders were in breaking up and destroying these two great parties. Lincoln on the one hand and Trumbull on the other, being disappointed politicians, and having retired or been driven to obscurity by an outraged constituency because of their political sins, formed a scheme to abolitionize the two parties and lead the old line Whigs and old line Democrats captive, bound hand and foot, into the Abolition camp. Giddings, Chase, Fred Douglass and Lovejoy were here to christen them whenever they were brought in. Lincoln went to work to dissolve the old line Whig party. Clay was dead, and although the sod was not yet green on his grave, this man undertook to bring into disrepute those great Compromise measures of 1850, with which Clay and Webster were identified. Up to 1854 the old Whig party and the Democratic party had stood on a common platform so far as this slavery question was concerned. You Whigs and we Democrats differed about the bank, the tariff, distribution, the specie circular and the sub-treasury, but we agreed on this slavery question and the true mode of preserving the peace and harmony of the Union. The Compromise measures of 1850 were introduced by Clay, were defended by Webster, and supported by Cass, and were approved by Fillmore, and sanctioned by the National men of both parties. They constituted a common plank upon which both Whigs and Democrats stood. In 1852 the Whig party, in its last National Convention at Baltimore, indorsed and approved these measures of Clay, and so did the National Convention of the Democratic party, held that same year. Thus the old line Whigs and the old line Democrats stood pledged to the great principle of self-government, which guaranties to the people of each Territory the right to decide the slavery question for themselves. In 1854, after the death of Clay and Webster, Mr. Lincoln, on the part of the Whigs, undertook to Abolitionize the Whig party, by dissolving it, transferring the members into the Abolition camp and making them train under Giddings, Fred Douglass, Lovejoy, Chase, Farnsworth, and other Abolition leaders. Trumbull undertook to dissolve the Democratic party by taking old Democrats into the Abolition camp. Mr. Lincoln was aided in his efforts by many leading Whigs throughout the State. Your member of Congress, Mr. Washburne, being one of the most active. Trumbull was aided by many renegades from the Democratic party, among whom were John Wentworth, Tom Turner, and others, with whom you are familiar.\n\n[Mr. Turner, who was one of the moderators, here interposed and said that he had drawn the resolutions which Senator Douglas had read.]\n\nMr. Douglas-Yes, and Turner says that he drew these resolutions. [\"Hurra for Turner, \" \"Hurra for Douglas.\"] That is right, give Turner cheers for drawing the resolutions if you approve them. If he drew those resolutions he will not deny that they are the creed of the Black Republican party.\n\nMr. Turner-\" They are our creed exactly.\"\n\nMr. Douglas-And yet Lincoln denies that he stands on them. Mr. Turner says that the creed of the Black Republican party is the admission of no more slave States, and yet Mr. Lincoln declares that he would not like to be placed in a position where he would have to vote for them. All I have to say to friend Lincoln is, that I do not think there is much danger of his being placed in such a position. As Mr. Lincoln would be very sorry to be placed in such an embarrassing position as to be obliged to vote on the admission of any more slave States, I propose, out of mere kindness, to relieve him from any such necessity.\n\nWhen the bargain between Lincoln and Trumbull was completed for Abolitionizing the Whig and Democratic parties, they \"spread\" over the State, Lincoln still pretending to be an old line Whig, in order to \"rope in\" the Whigs, and Trumbull pretending to be as good a Democrat as he ever was, in order to coax the Democrats over into the Abolition ranks. They played the part that \"decoy ducks\" play down on the Potomac river. In that part of the country they make artificial ducks and put them on the water in places where the wild ducks are to be found, for the purpose of decoying them. Well, Lincoln and Trumbull played the part of these \"decoy ducks\" and deceived enough old line Whigs and old line Democrats to elect a Black Republican Legislature. When that Legislature met, the first thing it did was to elect as Speaker of the House, the very man who is now boasting that he wrote the Abolition platform on which Lincoln will not stand. I want to know of Mr. Turner whether or not, when he was elected, he was a good embodiment of Republican principles?\n\nMr. Turner-\" I hope I was then and am now.\"\n\nMr. Douglas-He swears that he hopes he was then and is now. He wrote that Black Republican platform, and is satisfied with it now. I admire and acknowledge Turner's honesty. Every man of you know that what he says about these resolutions being the platform of the Black Republican party is true, and you also know that each one of these men who are shuffling and trying to deny it are only trying to cheat the people out of their votes for the purpose of deceiving them still more after the election. I propose to trace this thing a little further, in order that you can see what additional evidence there is to fasten this revolutionary platform upon the Black Republican party. When the Legislature assembled, there was an United States Senator to elect in the place of Gen. Shields, and before they proceeded to ballot, Lovejoy insisted on laying down certain principles by which to govern the party. It has been published to the world and satisfactorily proven that there was, at the time the alliance was made between Trumbull and Lincoln to Abolitionize the two parties, an agreement that Lincoln should take Shields's place in the United States Senate, and Trumbull should have mine so soon as they could conveniently get rid of me. When Lincoln was beaten for Shields's place, in a manner I will refer to in a few minutes, he felt very sore and restive; his friends grumbled, and some of them came out and charged that the most infamous treachery had been practiced against him; that the bargain was that Lincoln was to have had Shields's place, and Trumbull was to have waited for mine, but that Trumbull having the control of a few Abolitionized Democrats, he prevented them from voting for Lincoln, thus keeping him within a few votes of an election until he succeeded in forcing the party to drop him and elect Trumbull. Well, Trumbull having cheated Lincoln, his friends made a fuss, and in order to keep them and Lincoln quiet, the party were obliged to come forward, in advance, at the last State election, and make a pledge that they would go for Lincoln and nobody else. Lincoln could not be silenced in any other way.\n\nNow, there are a great many Black Republicans of you who do not know this thing was done. [\"White, white,\" and great clamor.] I wish to remind you that while Mr. Lincoln was speaking there was not a Democrat vulgar and blackguard enough to interrupt him. But I know that the shoe is pinching you. I am clinching Lincoln now, and you are scared to death for the result. I have seen this thing before. I have seen men make appointments for joint discussions, and the moment their man has been heard, try to interrupt and prevent a fair hearing of the other side. I have seen your mobs before, and defy your wrath. [Tremendous applause.] My friends, do not cheer, for I need my whole time. The object of the opposition is to occupy my attention in order to prevent me from giving the whole evidence and nailing this double dealing on the Black Republican party. As I have before said, Lovejoy demanded a declaration of principles on the part of the Black Republicans of the Legislature before going into an election for United States Senator. He offered the following preamble and resolutions which I hold in my hand:\n\nWHEREAS, Human slavery is a violation of the principles of natural and revealed rights; and whereas, the fathers of the Revolution, fully imbued with the spirit of these principles, declared freedom to be the inalienable birthright of all men; and whereas, the preamble to the Constitution of the United States avers that that instrument was ordained to establish justice, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity; and whereas, in furtherance of the above principles, slavery was forever prohibited in the old North-west Territory, and more recently in all that Territory lying west and north of the State of Missouri, by the act of the Federal Government; and whereas, the repeal of the prohibition last referred to, was contrary to the wishes of the people of Illinois, a violation of an implied compact, long deemed sacred by the citizens of the United States, and a wide departure from the uniform action of the General Government in relation to the extension of slavery; therefore,\n\n_Resolved, by the House of Representatives, the Senate concurring therein_, That our Senators in Congress be instructed, and our Representatives requested to introduce, if not otherwise introduced, and to vote for a bill to restore such prohibition to the aforesaid Territories, and also to extend a similar prohibition to all territory which now belongs to the United States, or which may hereafter come under their jurisdiction.\n\n_Resolved_, That our Senators in Congress be instructed, and our Representatives requested, to vote against the admission of any State into the Union, the Constitution of which does not prohibit slavery, whether the territory out of which such State may have been formed shall have been acquired by conquest, treaty, purchase, or from original territory of the United States.\n\n_Resolved,_ That our Senators in Congress be instructed, and our Representatives requested, to introduce and vote for a bill to repeal an act entitled \"an act respecting fugitives from justice and persons escaping from the service of their masters;\" and, failing in that, for such a modification of it as shall secure the right of _habeas corpus_ and trial by jury before the regularly-constituted authorities of the State, to all persons claimed as owing service or labor.\n\n(Cries of \"good,\" \"good,\" and cheers.) Yes, you say \"good,\" \"good,\" and I have no doubt you think so. Those resolutions were introduced by Mr. Lovejoy immediately preceding the election of Senator. They declared first, that the Wilmot Proviso must be applied to all territory north of 36 deg. 30 min. Secondly, that it must be applied to all territory south of 36 deg. 30 min. Thirdly, that it must be applied to all the territory now owned by the United States, and finally, that it must be applied to all territory hereafter to be acquired by the United States. The next resolution declares that no more slave States shall be admitted into this Union under any circumstances whatever, no matter whether they are formed out of territory now owned by us or that we may hereafter acquire, by treaty, by Congress, or in any manner whatever. The next resolution demands the unconditional repeal of the Fugitive Slave law, although its unconditional repeal would leave no provision for carrying out that clause of the Constitution of the United States which guaranties the surrender of fugitives. If they could not get an unconditional repeal, they demanded that that law should be so modified as to make it as nearly useless as possible. Now, I want to show you who voted for these resolutions. When the vote was taken on the first resolution it was decided in the affirmative-yeas 41, nays 32. You will find that this is a strict party vote, between the Democrats on the one hand, and the Black Republicans on the other. [Cries of \"White, white,\" and clamor.] I know your name, and always call things by their right name. The point I wish to call your attention to, is this: that these resolutions were adopted on the 7th day of February, and that on the 8th they went into an election for a United States Senator, and that day every man who voted for these resolutions, with but two exceptions, voted for Lincoln for the United States Senate. [\"Give us their names.\"] I will read the names over to you if you want them, but I believe your object is to occupy my time.\n\nOn the next resolution the vote stood-yeas 33, nays 40, and on the third resolution-yeas 35, nays 47. I wish to impress it upon you, that every man who voted for those resolutions, with but two exceptions, voted on the next day for Lincoln for U. S. Senator. Bear in mind that the members who thus voted for Lincoln were elected to the Legislature pledged to vote for no man for office under the State or Federal Government who was not committed to this Black Republican platform. They were all so pledged. Mr. Turner, who stands by me, and who then represented you, and who says that he wrote those resolutions, voted for Lincoln, when he was pledged not to do so unless Lincoln was in favor of those resolutions. I now ask Mr. Turner [turning to Mr. Turner], did you violate your pledge in voting for Mr. Lincoln, or did he commit himself to your platform before you cast your vote for him?\n\nI could go through the whole list of names here and show you that all the Black Republicans in the Legislature, who voted for Mr. Lincoln, had voted on the day previous for these resolutions. For instance, here are the names of Sargent and Little of Jo Daviess and Carroll, Thomas J. Turner of Stephenson, Lawrence of Boone and McHenry, Swan of Lake, Pinckney of Ogle county, and Lyman of Winnebago. Thus you see every member from your Congressional District voted for Mr. Lincoln, and they were pledged not to vote for him unless he was committed to the doctrine of no more slave States, the prohibition of slavery in the Territories, and the repeal of the Fugitive Slave law. Mr. Lincoln tells you today that he is not pledged to any such doctrine. Either Mr. Lincoln was then committed to those propositions, or Mr. Turner violated his pledges to you when he voted for him. Either Lincoln was pledged to each one of those propositions, or else every Black Republican Representative from this Congressional District violated his pledge of honor to his constituents by voting for him. I ask you which horn of the dilemma will you take? Will you hold Lincoln up to the platform of his party, or will you accuse every Representative you had in the Legislature of violating his pledge of honor to his constituents? There is no escape for you. Either Mr. Lincoln was committed to those propositions, or your members violated their faith. Take either horn of the dilemma you choose. There is no dodging the question; I want Lincoln's answer. He says he was not pledged to repeal the Fugitive Slave law, that he does not quite like to do it; he will not introduce a law to repeal it, but thinks there ought to be some law; he does not tell what it ought to be; upon the whole, he is altogether undecided, and don't know what to think or do. That is the substance of his answer upon the repeal of the Fugitive Slave law. I put the question to him distinctly, whether he indorsed that part of the Black Republican platform which calls for the entire abrogation and repeal of the Fugitive Slave law. He answers no! that he does not indorse that, but he does not tell what he is for, or what he will vote for. His answer is, in fact, no answer at all. Why cannot he speak out and say what he is for and what he will do?\n\nIn regard to there being no more slave States, he is not pledged to that. He would not like, he says, to be put in a position where he would have to vote one way or another upon that question. I pray you, do not put him in a position that would embarrass him so much. Gentlemen, if he goes to the Senate, he may be put in that position, and then which way will he vote?\n\n[A Voice-''How will you vote?\"]\n\nMr. Douglas-I will vote for the admission of just such a State as by the form of their Constitution the people show they want; if they want slavery, they shall have it; if they prohibit slavery it shall be prohibited. They can form their institutions to please themselves, subject only to the Constitution; and I for one stand ready to receive them into the Union. Why cannot your Black Republican candidates talk out as plain as that when they are questioned?\n\nI do not want to cheat any man out of his vote. No man is deceived in regard to my principles if I have the power to express myself in terms explicit enough to convey my ideas.\n\nMr. Lincoln made a speech when he was nominated for the United States Senate which covers all these Abolition platforms. He there lays down a proposition so broad in its abolitionism as to cover the whole ground.\n\n\"In my opinion it [the slavery agitation] will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed. 'A house divided against itself cannot stand.' I believe this Government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the house to fall-but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or all the other. Either the opponents of Slavery will arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction, or its advocates will push it forward till it shall become alike lawful in all the States-old as well as new, North as well as South.\"\n\nThere you find that Mr. Lincoln lays down the doctrine that this Union cannot endure divided as our fathers made it, with free and slave States. He says they must all become one thing, or all the other; that they must all be free or all slave, or else the Union cannot continue to exist. It being his opinion that to admit any more slave States, to continue to divide the Union into free and slave States, will dissolve it. I want to know of Mr. Lincoln whether he will vote for the admission of another slave State.\n\nHe tells you the Union cannot exist unless the States are all free or all slave; he tells you that he is opposed to making them all slave, and hence he is for making them all free, in order that the Union may exist; and yet he will not say that he will not vote against another slave State, knowing that the Union must be dissolved if he votes for it. I ask you if that is fair dealing? The true intent and inevitable conclusion to be drawn from his first Springfield speech is, that he is opposed to the admission of any more slave States under any circumstance. If he is so opposed, why not say so? If he believes this Union cannot endure divided into free and slave States, that they must all become free in order to save the Union, he is bound as an honest man, to vote against any more slave States. If he believes it he is bound to do it. Show me that it is my duty in order to save the Union to do a particular act, and I will do it if the Constitution does not prohibit it. (Applause.) I am not for the dissolution of the Union under any circumstances. (Renewed applause.) I will pursue no course of conduct that will give just cause for the dissolution of the Union. The hope of the friends of freedom throughout the world rests upon the perpetuity of this Union. The down-trodden and oppressed people who are suffering under European despotism all look with hope and anxiety to the American Union as the only resting place and permanent home of freedom and self-government.\n\nMr. Lincoln says that he believes that this Union cannot continue to endure with slave States in it, and yet he will not tell you distinctly whether he will vote for or against the admission of any more slave States, but says he would not like to be put to the test. (Laughter.) I do not think he will be put to the test. (Renewed laughter.) I do not think that the people of Illinois desire a man to represent them who would not like to be put to the test on the performance of a high constitutional duty. (Cries of good.) I will retire in shame from the Senate of the United States when I am not willing to be put to the test in the performance of my duty. I have been put to severe tests. (That is so.) I have stood by my principles in fair weather and in foul, in the sunshine and in the rain. I have defended the great principles of self-government here among you when Northern sentiment ran in a torrent against me, (A VOICE,-that is so,) and I have defended that same great principle when Southern sentiment came down like an avalanche upon me. I was not afraid of any test they put to me. I knew I was right-I knew my principles were sound-I knew that the people would see in the end that I had done right, and I knew that the God of Heaven would smile upon me if I was faithful in the performance of my duty. (Cries of good, cheers, and laughter.)\n\nMr. Lincoln makes a charge of corruption against the Supreme Court of the United States, and two Presidents of the United States, and attempts to bolster it up by saying that I did the same against the Washington _Union_. Suppose I did make that charge of corruption against the Washington _Union_, when it was true, does that justify him in making a false charge against me and others? That is the question I would put. He says that at the time the Nebraska bill was introduced, and before it was passed, there was a conspiracy between the Judges of the Supreme Court, President Pierce, President Buchanan and myself by that bill, and the decision of the court to break down the barrier and establish slavery all over the Union. Does he not know that that charge is historically false as against President Buchanan? He knows that Mr. Buchanan was at that time in England, representing this country with distinguished ability at the Court of St. James, that he was there for a long time before, and did not return for a year or more after. He knows that to be true, and that fact proves his charge to be false as against Mr. Buchanan. (Cheers.) Then again, I wish to call his attention to the fact that at the time the Nebraska bill was passed, the Dred Scott case was not before the Supreme Court at all; it was not upon the docket of the Supreme Court; it had not been brought there, and the Judges in all probability knew nothing of it. Thus the history of the country proves the charge to be false as against them. As to President Pierce, his high character as a man of integrity and honor is enough to vindicate him from such a charge, (laughter and applause,) and as to myself, I pronounce the charge an infamous lie, whenever and wherever made, and by whomsoever made. I am willing that Mr. Lincoln should go and rake up every public act of mine, every measure I have introduced, report I have made, speech delivered, and criticise them, but when he charges upon me a corrupt conspiracy for the purpose of perverting the institutions of the country, I brand it as it deserves. I say the history of the country proves it to be false, and that it could not have been possible at the time. But now he tries to protect himself in this charge, because I made a charge against the Washington _Union_. My speech in the Senate against the Washington _Union_ was made because it advocated a revolutionary doctrine, by declaring that the free States had not the right to prohibit slavery within their own limits. Because I made that charge against the Washington _Union_, Mr. Lincoln says it was a charge against Mr. Buchanan. Suppose it was; is Mr. Lincoln the peculiar defender of Mr. Buchanan? Is he so interested in the Federal Administration, and so bound to it, that he must jump to the rescue and defend it from every attack that I may make against it? (Great laughter and cheers.) I understand the whole thing. The Washington _Union_, under that most corrupt of all men, Cornelius Wendell, is advocating Mr. Lincoln's claim to the Senate. Wendell was the printer of the last Black Republican House of Representatives; he was a candidate before the present Democratic House, but was ignominiously kicked out, and then he took the money which he had made out of the public printing by means of the Black Republicans, bought the Washington _Union_, and is now publishing it in the name of the Democratic party, and advocating Mr. Lincoln's election to the Senate. Mr. Lincoln therefore considers an attack upon Wendell and his corrupt gang as a personal attack upon him. (Immense cheering and laughter.) This only proves what I have charged, that there is an alliance between Lincoln and his supporters, and the Federal office-holders of this State, and Presidential aspirants out of it, to break me down at home.\n\n[A VOICE.-That is impossible, and cheering.]\n\nMr. Lincoln feels bound to come in to the rescue of the Washington _Union_. In that speech which I delivered in answer to the Washington _Union_, I made it distinctly against the _Union_, and against the _Union_ alone. I did not choose to go beyond that. If I have occasion to attack the President's conduct, I will do it in language that will not be misunderstood. When I differed with the President, I spoke out so that you all heard me. (\"That you did,\" and cheers.) That question passed away; it resulted in the triumph of my principle by allowing the people to do as they please, and there is an end of the controversy. Whenever the great principle of self-government-the right of the people to make their own Constitution, and come into the Union with slavery or without it, as they see proper, shall again arise, you will find me standing firm in defense of that principle, and fighting whoever fights it. (\"Right, right.\" \"Good, good,\" and cheers.) If Mr. Buchanan stands, as I doubt not he will, by the recommendation contained in his Message, that hereafter all State Constitutions ought to be submitted to the people before the admission of the State into the Union, he will find me standing by him firmly, shoulder to shoulder, in carrying it out. I know Mr. Lincoln's object; he wants to divide the Democratic party, in order that he may defeat me and get to the Senate.\n\nMr. Douglas' time here expired, and he stopped on the moment.\n\n**Mr. Lincon's Reply**\n\nAs Mr. Lincoln arose he was greeted with vociferous cheers. He said:\n\nMy friends: It will readily occur to you that I cannot, in half an hour, notice all the things that so able a man as Judge Douglas can say in an hour and a half; and I hope, therefore, if there be any thing that he has said upon which you would like to hear something from me, but which I omit to comment upon, you will bear in mind that it would be expecting an impossibility for me to go over his whole ground. I can but take up some of the points that he has dwelt upon, and employed my half-hour specially on them.\n\nThe first thing I have to say to you is a word in regard to Judge Douglas's declaration about the \"vulgarity and blackguardism\" in the audience-that no such thing, as he says, was shown by any Democrat while I was speaking. Now, I only wish, by way of reply on this subject, to say that while _I_ was speaking, _I_ used no \"vulgarity or blackguardism\" toward any Democrat. [Great laughter and applause.]\n\nNow, my friends, I come to all this long portion of the Judge's speech-perhaps half of it-which he has devoted to the various resolutions and platforms that have been adopted in the different counties in the different Congressional Districts, and in the Illinois Legislature-which he supposes are at variance with the positions I have assumed before you to-day. It is true that many of these resolutions are at variance with the positions I have here assumed. All I have to ask is that we talk reasonably and rationally about it. I happen to know, the Judge's opinion to the contrary notwithstanding, that I have never tried to conceal my opinions, nor tried to deceive any one in reference to them. He may go and examine all the members who voted for me for United States Senator in 1855, after the election of 1854. They were pledged to certain things here at home, and were determined to have pledges from me, and if he will find any of these persons who will tell him any thing inconsistent with what I say now, I will resign, or rather retire from the race, and give him no more trouble. [Applause.] The plain truth is this: At the introduction of the Nebraska policy, we believed there was a new era being introduced in the history of the Republic, which tended to the spread and perpetuation of slavery.But in our opposition to that measure we did not agree with one another in every thing. The people in the north end of the State were for stronger measures of opposition than we of the central and Southern portions of the State, but we were all opposed to the Nebraska doctrine. We had that one feeling and that one sentiment in common. You at the north end met in your Conventions and passed your resolutions. We in the middle of the State and further south did not hold such Conventions and pass the same resolutions, although we had in general a common view and a common sentiment. So that these meetings which the Judge has alluded to, and the resolutions he has read from, were local, and did not spread over the whole State. We at last met together in 1856, from all parts of the State, and we agreed upon a common platform. You, who held more extreme notions, either yielded those notions, or if not wholly yielding them, agreed to yield them practically, for the sake of embodying the opposition to the measures which the opposite party were pushing forward at that time. We met you then, and if there was any thing yielded, it was for practical purposes. We agreed then upon a platform for the party throughout the entire State of Illinois, and now we are all bound as a party, _to that platform_. And I say here to you, if any one expects of me-in the case of my election-that I will do any thing not signified by our Republican platform and my answers here to-day, I tell you very frankly that person will be deceived. I do not ask for the vote of any one who supposes that I have secret purposes or pledges that I dare not speak out. Cannot the Judge be satisfied? If he fears, in the unfortunate case of my election, [Laughter.] that my going to Washington will enable me to advocate sentiments contrary to those which I expressed when you voted for and elected me, I assure him that his fears are wholly needless and groundless. Is the Judge really afraid of any such thing? [Laughter.] I'll tell you what he is afraid of. _He is afraid we'll all pull together_. [Applause, and cries of \"we will, we will.\"] This is what alarms him more than anything else. [Laughter.] For my part, I do hope that all of us, entertaining a common sentiment in opposition to what appears to us a design to nationalize and perpetuate slavery, will waive minor differences on questions which either belong to the dead pastor the distant future, and all pull together in this struggle. What are your sentiments? [\"We will, we will,\" and loud cheers.] If it be true, that on the ground which I occupy-ground which I occupy as frankly and boldly as Judge Douglas does his-my views, though partly coinciding with yours, are not as perfectly in accordance with your feelings as his are, I do say to you in all candor, go for him and not for me. I hope to deal in all things fairly with Judge Douglas, and with the people of the State, in this contest. And if I should never be elected to any office, I trust I may go down with no stain of falsehood upon my reputation-notwithstanding the hard opinions Judge Douglas chooses to entertain of me. [Laughter.]\n\nThe Judge has again addressed himself to the abolition tendencies of a speech of mine, made at Springfield in June last. I have so often tried to answer what he is always saying on that melancholy theme, that I almost turn with disgust from the discussion - from the repetition of an answer to it. I trust that nearly all of this intelligent audience have read that speech. [\"We have; we have.\"] If you have, I may venture to leave it to you to inspect it closely, and see whether it contains any of those \"bugaboos\" which frighten Judge Douglas. [Laughter.]\n\nThe Judge complains that I did not fully answer his questions. If I have the sense to comprehend and answer those questions, I have done so fairly. If it can be pointed out to me how I can more fully and fairly answer him, I aver I have not the sense to see how it is to be done. He says I do not declare I would in any event vote for the admission of a slave State into the Union. If I have been fairly reported he will see that I did give an explicit answer to his interrogatories, I did not merely say that I would dislike to be put to the test; but I said clearly, if I were put to the test, and a Territory from which slavery had been excluded should present herself with a State Constitution sanctioning slavery-a most extraordinary thing and wholly unlikely to happen-I did not see how I could avoid voting for her admission. But he refuses to understand that I said so, and he wants this audience to understand that I did not say so. Yet it will be so reported in the printed speech that he cannot help seeing it.\n\nHe says if I should vote for the admission of a slave State I would be voting for a dissolution of the Union, because I hold that the Union cannot permanently exist half slave and half free. I repeat that I do not believe this Government _can_ endure permanently half slave and half free, yet I do not admit, nor does it at all follow, that the admission of a single slave State will permanently fix the character and establish this as a universal slave nation. The Judge is very happy indeed at working up these quibbles. [Laughter and cheers.] Before leaving the subject of answering questions I aver as my confident belief, when you come to see our speeches in print, that you will find every question which he has asked me more fairly and boldly and fully answered than he has answered those which I put to him. Is not that so? [Cries of yes, yes] The two speeches may be placed side by side; and I will venture to leave it to impartial judges whether his questions have not been more directly and circumstantially answered than mine.\n\nJudge Douglas says he made a charge upon the editor of the Washington _Union, alone_, of entertaining a purpose to rob the States of their power to exclude slavery from their limits. I undertake to say, and I make the direct issue, that he did _not_ make his charge against the editor of the _Union_ alone. [Applause.] I will undertake to prove by the record here, that he made that charge against more and higher dignitaries than the editor of the Washington _Union_. I am quite aware that he was shirking and dodging around the form in which he put it, but I can make it manifest that he leveled his \"fatal blow\" against more persons than this Washington editor. Will he dodge it now by alleging that I am trying to defend Mr. Buchanan against the charge? Not at all. Am I not making the same charge myself? [Laughter and applause.] I am trying to show that you, Judge Douglas, are a witness on my side. [Renewed Laughter.] I am not defending Buchanan, and I will tell Judge Douglas that in my opinion, when he made that charge, he had an eye farther north than he was to-day. He was then fighting against people who called _him_ a Black Republican and an Abolitionist. It is mixed all through his speech, and it is tolerably manifest that his eye was a great deal farther north than it is to-day. [Cheers and laughter.] The Judge says that though he made this charge, Toombs got up and declared there was not a man in the United States, except the editor of the _Union_, who was in favor of the doctrines put forth in that article. And thereupon, I understand that the Judge withdrew the charge. Although he had taken extracts from the newspaper, and then from the Lecompton Constitution, to show the existence of a conspiracy to bring about a \"fatal blow,\" by which the States were to be deprived of the right of excluding slavery, it all went to pot as soon as Toombs got up and told him it was not true. [Laughter.] It reminds me of the story that John Phoenix, the California railroad surveyor, tells. He says they started out from the Plaza to the Mission of Dolores. They had two ways of determining distances. One was by a chain and pins taken over the ground. The other was by a \"go-it-ometer''-an invention of his own-a three-legged instrument, with which he computed a series of triangles between the points. At night he turned to the chain-man to ascertain what distance they had come, and found that by some mistake he had merely dragged the chain over the ground without keeping any record. By the \"go-it-ometer\" he found he had made ten miles. Being skeptical about this, he asked a drayman who was passing how far it was to the plaza. The drayman replied it was just half a mile, and the surveyor put it down in his book-just as Judge Douglas says, after he had made his calculations and computations, he took Toombs' statement. [Great laughter.] I have no doubt that after Judge Douglas had made his charge, he was as easily satisfied about its truth as the surveyor was of the drayman's statement of the distance to the plaza. [Renewed laughter.] Yet it is a fact that the man who put forth all that matter which Douglas deemed a \"fatal blow\" at State sovereignty, was elected by the Democrats as public printer.\n\nNow, gentlemen, you may take Judge Douglas's speech of March 22d, 1858, beginning about the middle of page 21, and reading to the bottom of page 24, and you will find the evidence on which I say that he did not make his charge against the editor of the _Union_ alone. I cannot stop to read it, but I will give it to the reporters. Judge Douglas said:\n\n\"Mr. President, you here find several distinct propositions advanced boldly by the Washington _Union_ editorially and apparently _authoritatively_, and every man who questions any of them is denounced as an Abolitionist, a Freesoiler, a fanatic. The propositions are, first, that the primary object of all government at its original institution is the protection of persons and property; second, that the Constitution of the United States declares that the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States; and that, therefore, thirdly, all State laws, whether organic or otherwise, which prohibit the citizens of one State from settling in another with their slave property, and especially declaring it forfeited, are direct violations of the original intention of the Government and Constitution of the United States; and fourth, that the emancipation of the slaves of the Northern States was a gross outrage on the rights of property, inasmuch as it was involuntarily done on the part of the owner.\"\n\n\"Remember that this article was published in the _Union_ on the 17th of November, and on the 18th appeared the first article giving the adhesion of the _Union_ to the Lecompton Constitution. It was in these words:\n\n\" KANSAS AND HER CONSTITUTION.-The vexed question is settled. The problem is solved. The dead point of danger is passed. All serious trouble to Kansas affairs is over and gone'-\n\n\"And a column, nearly, of the same sort. Then, when you come to look into the Lecompton Constitution, you find the same doctrine incorporated in it which was put forth editorially in the _Union_. What is it?\n\n\" ARTICLE 7, _Section_ 1. The right of property is before and higher than any constitutional sanction; and the right of the owner of a slave to such slave and its increase is the same and as invariable as the right of the owner of any property whatever.'\n\n\"Then in the schedule is a provision that the Constitution may be amended after 1864 by a two-thirds vote.\n\n\" But no alteration shall be made to affect the right of property in the ownership of slaves.'\n\n\"It will be seen by these clauses in the Lecompton Constitution that they are identical in spirit with this _authoritative_ article in the Washington _Union_ of the day previous to its indorsement of this Constitution.\n\n\"When I saw that article in the _Union_ of the 17th of November, followed by the glorification of the Lecompton Constitution on the 18th of November, and this clause in the Constitution asserting the doctrine that a State has no right to prohibit slavery within its limits, I saw that there was a _fatal blow_ being struck at the sovereignty of the States of this Union.\"\n\nHere he says, \"Mr. President, you here find several distinct propositions advanced boldly, and apparently _authoritatively_.\" By whose authority, Judge Douglas? [Great cheers and laughter.] Again, he says in another place, \"It will be seen by these clauses in the Lecompton Constitution, that they are identical in spirit with this _authoritative_ article.\" _By whose authority_? [Renewed cheers.] Who do you mean to say authorized the publication of these articles? He knows that the Washington _Union_ is considered the organ of the Administration. _I_ demand of Judge Douglas _by whose authority_ he meant to say those articles were published, if not by the authority of the President of the United States and his Cabinet? I defy him to show whom he referred to, if not to these high functionaries in the Federal Government. More than this, he says the articles in that paper and the provisions of the Lecompton Constitution are \"identical,\" and being identical, he argues that the authors are co-operating and conspiring together. He does not use the word \"conspiring,\" but what other construction can you put upon it? He winds up with this:\n\n\"When I saw that article in the _Union_ of the 17th of November, followed by the glorification of the Lecompton Constitution on the 18th of November, and this clause in the Constitution asserting the doctrine that a State has no right to prohibit slavery within its limits, I saw that there was a _fatal blow_ being struck at the sovereignty of the States of this Union.\"\n\nI ask him if all this fuss was made over the editor of this newspaper. [Laughter.] It would be a terribly \"_fatal_ blow\" indeed which a single man could strike, when no President, no Cabinet officer, no member of Congress, was giving strength and efficiency to the moment. Out of respect to Judge Douglas's good sense I must believe he didn't manufacture his idea of the \"fatal\" character of that blow out of such a miserable scapegrace as he represents that editor to be. But the Judge's eye is farther south now. [Laughter and cheers.] Then, it was very peculiarly and decidedly north. His hope rested on the idea of visiting the great \"Black Republican\" party, and making it the tail of his new kite. [Great laughter.] He knows he was then expecting from day to day to turn Republican and place himself at the head [of] our organization. He has found that these despised \"Black Republicans\" estimate him by a standard which he has taught them none too well. Hence he is crawling back into his old camp, and you will find him eventually installed in full fellowship among those whom he was then battling, and with whom he now pretends to be at such fearful variance. [Loud applause and cries of \"go on, go on.\"] I cannot, gentlemen, my time has expired.\n\n[Third Debate](https://www.nps.gov/liho/historyculture/debate3.htm)\n\n[Back to Debates](https://www.nps.gov/liho/historyculture/debates.htm)\n\n[Back to History and Culture](https://www.nps.gov/liho/historyculture/index.htm)"

        "full_text_segment": "Citizens of Russia, friends,\n\nMy address concerns the events in Ukraine and why this is so important for us, for Russia. Of course, my message is also addressed to our compatriots in Ukraine.\n\nThe matter is very serious and needs to be discussed in depth.\n\nThe situation in Donbass has reached a critical, acute stage. I am speaking to you directly today not only to explain what is happening but also to inform you of the decisions being made as well as potential further steps.\n\nI would like to emphasise again that Ukraine is not just a neighbouring country for us. It is an inalienable part of our own history, culture and spiritual space. These are our comrades, those dearest to us– not only colleagues, friends and people who once served together, but also relatives, people bound by blood, by family ties.\n\nSince time immemorial, the people living in the south-west of what has historically been Russian land have called themselves Russians and Orthodox Christians. This was the case before the 17 th century, when a portion of this territory rejoined the Russian state, and after.\n\nIt seems to us that, generally speaking, we all know these facts, that this is common knowledge. Still, it is necessary to say at least a few words about the history of this issue in order to understand what is happening today, to explain the motives behind Russia’s actions and what we aim to achieve.\n\nSo, I will start with the fact that modern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia or, to be more precise, by Bolshevik, Communist Russia. This process started practically right after the 1917 revolution, and Lenin and his associates did it in a way that was extremely harsh on Russia– by separating, severing what is historically Russian land. Nobody asked the millions of people living there what they thought.\n\nThen, both before and after the Great Patriotic War, Stalin incorporated in the USSR and transferred to Ukraine some lands that previously belonged to Poland, Romania and Hungary. In the process, he gave Poland part of what was traditionally German land as compensation, and in 1954, Khrushchev took Crimea away from Russia for some reason and also gave it to Ukraine. In effect, this is how the territory of modern Ukraine was formed.\n\nBut now I would like to focus attention on the initial period of the USSR’s formation. I believe this is extremely important for us. I will have to approach it from a distance, so to speak.\n\nI will remind you that after the 1917 October Revolution and the subsequent Civil War, the Bolsheviks set about creating a new statehood. They had rather serious disagreements among themselves on this point. In 1922, Stalin occupied the positions of both the General Secretary of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the People’s Commissar for Ethnic Affairs. He suggested building the country on the principles of autonomisation that is, giving the republics– the future administrative and territorial entities– broad powers upon joining a unified state.\n\nLenin criticised this plan and suggested making concessions to the nationalists, whom he called “independents” at that time. Lenin’s ideas of what amounted in essence to a confederative state arrangement and a slogan about the right of nations to self-determination, up to secession, were laid in the foundation of Soviet statehood. Initially they were confirmed in the Declaration on the Formation of the USSR in 1922, and later on, after Lenin’s death, were enshrined in the 1924 Soviet Constitution.\n\nThis immediately raises many questions. The first is really the main one: why was it necessary to appease the nationalists, to satisfy the ceaselessly growing nationalist ambitions on the outskirts of the former empire? What was the point of transferring to the newly, often arbitrarily formed administrative units– the union republics– vast territories that had nothing to do with them? Let me repeat that these territories were transferred along with the population of what was historically Russia.\n\nMoreover, these administrative units were de facto given the status and form of national state entities. That raises another question: why was it necessary to make such generous gifts, beyond the wildest dreams of the most zealous nationalists and, on top of all that, give the republics the right to secede from the unified state without any conditions?\n\nAt first glance, this looks absolutely incomprehensible, even crazy. But only at first glance. There is an explanation. After the revolution, the Bolsheviks’ main goal was to stay in power at all costs, absolutely at all costs. They did everything for this purpose: accepted the humiliating Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, although the military and economic situation in Kaiser Germany and its allies was dramatic and the outcome of the First World War was a foregone conclusion, and satisfied any demands and wishes of the nationalists within the country.\n\nWhen it comes to the historical destiny of Russia and its peoples, Lenin’s principles of state development were not just a mistake; they were worse than a mistake, as the saying goes. This became patently clear after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nOf course, we cannot change past events, but we must at least admit them openly and honestly, without any reservations or politicking. Personally, I can add that no political factors, however impressive or profitable they may seem at any given moment, can or may be used as the fundamental principles of statehood.\n\nI am not trying to put the blame on anyone. The situation in the country at that time, both before and after the Civil War, was extremely complicated; it was critical. The only thing I would like to say today is that this is exactly how it was. It is a historical fact. Actually, as I have already said, Soviet Ukraine is the result of the Bolsheviks’ policy and can be rightfully called “Vladimir Lenin’s Ukraine.” He was its creator and architect. This is fully and comprehensively corroborated by archival documents, including Lenin’s harsh instructions regarding Donbass, which was actually shoved into Ukraine. And today the“grateful progeny” has overturned monuments to Lenin in Ukraine. They call it decommunization.\n\nYou want decommunization? Very well, this suits us just fine. But why stop halfway? We are ready to show what real decommunizations would mean for Ukraine.\n\nGoing back to history, I would like to repeat that the Soviet Union was established in the place of the former Russian Empire in 1922. But practice showed immediately that it was impossible to preserve or govern such a vast and complex territory on the amorphous principles that amounted to confederation. They were far removed from reality and the historical tradition.\n\nIt is logical that the Red Terror and a rapid slide into Stalin’s dictatorship, the domination of the communist ideology and the Communist Party’s monopoly on power, nationalisation and the planned economy– all this transformed the formally declared but ineffective principles of government into a mere declaration. In reality, the union republics did not have any sovereign rights, none at all. The practical result was the creation of a tightly centralised and absolutely unitary state.\n\nIn fact, what Stalin fully implemented was not Lenin’s but his own principles of government. But he did not make the relevant amendments to the cornerstone documents, to the Constitution, and he did not formally revise Lenin’s principles underlying the Soviet Union. From the look of it, there seemed to be no need for that, because everything seemed to be working well in conditions of the totalitarian regime, and outwardly it looked wonderful, attractive and even super-democratic.\n\nAnd yet, it is a great pity that the fundamental and formally legal foundations of our state were not promptly cleansed of the odious and utopian fantasies inspired by the revolution, which are absolutely destructive for any normal state. As it often happened in our country before, nobody gave any thought to the future.\n\nIt seems that the Communist Party leaders were convinced that they had created a solid system of government and that their policies had settled the ethnic issue for good. But falsification, misconception, and tampering with public opinion have a high cost. The virus of nationalist ambitions is still with us, and the mine laid at the initial stage to destroy state immunity to the disease of nationalism was ticking. As I have already said, the mine was the right of secession from the Soviet Union.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the increasing socioeconomic problems and the apparent crisis of the planned economy aggravated the ethnic issue, which essentially was not based on any expectations or unfulfilled dreams of the Soviet peoples but primarily the growing appetites of the local elites.\n\nHowever, instead of analysing the situation, taking appropriate measures, first of all in the economy, and gradually transforming the political system and government in a well-considered and balanced manner, the Communist Party leadership only engaged in open doubletalk about the revival of the Leninist principle of national self-determination.\n\nMoreover, in the course of power struggle within the Communist Party itself, each of the opposing sides, in a bid to expand its support base, started to thoughtlessly incite and encourage nationalist sentiments, manipulating them and promising their potential supporters whatever they wished. Against the backdrop of the superficial and populist rhetoric about democracy and a bright future based either on a market or a planned economy, but amid a true impoverishment of people and widespread shortages, no one among the powers that be was thinking about the inevitable tragic consequences for the country.\n\nNext, they entirely embarked on the track beaten at the inception of the USSR and pandering to the ambitions of the nationalist elites nurtured within their own party ranks. But in so doing, they forgot that the CPSU no longer had– thank God– the tools for retaining power and the country itself, tools such as state terror and a Stalinist-type dictatorship, and that the notorious guiding role of the party was disappearing without a trace, like a morning mist, right before their eyes.\n\nAnd then, the September 1989 plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee approved a truly fatal document, the so-called ethnic policy of the party in modern conditions, the CPSU platform. It included the following provisions, I quote: “The republics of the USSR shall possess all the rights appropriate to their status as sovereign socialist states.”\n\nThe next point: “The supreme representative bodies of power of the USSR republics can challenge and suspend the operation of the USSR Government’s resolutions and directives in their territory.”\n\nAnd finally: “Each republic of the USSR shall have citizenship of its own, which shall apply to all of its residents.”\n\nWasn’t it clear what these formulas and decisions would lead to?\n\nNow is not the time or place to go into matters pertaining to state or constitutional law, or define the concept of citizenship. But one may wonder: why was it necessary to rock the country even more in that already complicated situation? The facts remain.\n\nEven two years before the collapse of the USSR, its fate was actually predetermined. It is now that radicals and nationalists, including and primarily those in Ukraine, are taking credit for having gained independence. As we can see, this is absolutely wrong. The disintegration of our united country was brought about by the historic, strategic mistakes on the part of the Bolshevik leaders and the CPSU leadership, mistakes committed at different times in state-building and in economic and ethnic policies. The collapse of the historical Russia known as the USSR is on their conscience.\n\nDespite all these injustices, lies and outright pillage of Russia, it was our people who accepted the new geopolitical reality that took shape after the dissolution of the USSR, and recognised the new independent states. Not only did Russia recognise these countries, but helped its CIS partners, even though it faced a very dire situation itself. This included our Ukrainian colleagues, who turned to us for financial support many times from the very moment they declared independence. Our country provided this assistance while respecting Ukraine’s dignity and sovereignty.\n\nAccording to expert assessments, confirmed by a simple calculation of our energy prices, the subsidised loans Russia provided to Ukraine along with economic and trade preferences, the overall benefit for the Ukrainian budget in the period from 1991 to 2013 amounted to$250 billion.\n\nHowever, there was more to it than that. By the end of 1991, the USSR owed some $100 billion to other countries and international funds. Initially, there was this idea that all former Soviet republics will pay back these loans together, in the spirit of solidarity and proportionally to their economic potential. However, Russia undertook to pay back all Soviet debts and delivered on this promise by completing this process in 2017.\n\nIn exchange for that, the newly independent states had to hand over to Russia part of the Soviet foreign assets. An agreement to this effect was reached with Ukraine in December 1994. However, Kiev failed to ratify these agreements and later simply refused to honour them by making demands for a share of the Diamond Treasury, gold reserves, as well as former USSR property and other assets abroad.\n\nNevertheless, despite all these challenges, Russia always worked with Ukraine in an open and honest manner and, as I have already said, with respect for its interests. We developed our ties in multiple fields. Thus, in 2011, bilateral trade exceeded $50 billion. Let me note that in 2019, that is before the pandemic, Ukraine’s trade with all EU countries combined was below this indicator.\n\nAt the same time, it was striking how the Ukrainian authorities always preferred dealing with Russia in a way that ensured that they enjoy all the rights and privileges while remaining free from any obligations.\n\nThe officials in Kiev replaced partnership with a parasitic attitude acting at times in an extremely brash manner. Suffice it to recall the continuous blackmail on energy transits and the fact that they literally stole gas.\n\nI can add that Kiev tried to use dialogue with Russia as a bargaining chip in its relations with the West, using the threat of closer ties with Russia for blackmailing the West to secure preferences by claiming that otherwise Russia would have a bigger influence in Ukraine.\n\nAt the same time, the Ukrainian authorities– I would like to emphasise this– began by building their statehood on the negation of everything that united us, trying to distort the mentality and historical memory of millions of people, of entire generations living in Ukraine. It is not surprising that Ukrainian society was faced with the rise of far-right nationalism, which rapidly developed into aggressive Russophobia and neo-Nazism. This resulted in the participation of Ukrainian nationalists and neo-Nazis in the terrorist groups in the North Caucasus and the increasingly loud territorial claims to Russia.\n\nA role in this was played by external forces, which used a ramified network of NGOs and special services to nurture their clients in Ukraine and to bring their representatives to the seats of authority.\n\nIt should be noted that Ukraine actually never had stable traditions of real statehood. And, therefore, in 1991 it opted for mindlessly emulating foreign models, which have no relation to history or Ukrainian realities. Political government institutions were readjusted many times to the rapidly growing clans and their self-serving interests, which had nothing to do with the interests of the Ukrainian people.\n\nEssentially, the so-called pro-Western civilisational choice made by the oligarchic Ukrainian authorities was not and is not aimed at creating better conditions in the interests of people’s well-being but at keeping the billions of dollars that the oligarchs have stolen from the Ukrainians and are holding in their accounts in Western banks, while reverently accommodating the geopolitical rivals of Russia.\n\nSome industrial and financial groups and the parties and politicians on their payroll relied on the nationalists and radicals from the very beginning. Others claimed to be in favour of good relations with Russia and cultural and language diversity, coming to power with the help of their citizens who sincerely supported their declared aspirations, including the millions of people in the south-eastern regions. But after getting the positions they coveted, these people immediately betrayed their voters, going back on their election promises and instead steering a policy prompted by the radicals and sometimes even persecuting their former allies– the public organisations that supported bilingualism and cooperation with Russia. These people took advantage of the fact that their voters were mostly law-abiding citizens with moderate views who trusted the authorities, and that, unlike the radicals, they would not act aggressively or make use of illegal instruments.\n\nMeanwhile, the radicals became increasingly brazen in their actions and made more demands every year. They found it easy to force their will on the weak authorities, which were infected with the virus of nationalism and corruption as well and which artfully replaced the real cultural, economic and social interests of the people and Ukraine’s true sovereignty with various ethnic speculations and formal ethnic attributes.\n\nA stable statehood has never developed in Ukraine; its electoral and other political procedures just serve as a cover, a screen for the redistribution of power and property between various oligarchic clans.\n\nCorruption, which is certainly a challenge and a problem for many countries, including Russia, has gone beyond the usual scope in Ukraine. It has literally permeated and corroded Ukrainian statehood, the entire system, and all branches of power.\n\nRadical nationalists took advantage of the justified public discontent and saddled the Maidan protest, escalating it to a coup d'état in 2014. They also had direct assistance from foreign states. According to reports, the US Embassy provided $1 million a day to support the so-called protest camp on Independence Square in Kiev. In addition, large amounts were impudently transferred directly to the opposition leaders’ bank accounts, tens of millions of dollars. But the people who actually suffered, the families of those who died in the clashes provoked in the streets and squares of Kiev and other cities, how much did they get in the end? Better not ask.\n\nThe nationalists who have seized power have unleashed a persecution, a real terror campaign against those who opposed their anti-constitutional actions. Politicians, journalists, and public activists were harassed and publicly humiliated. A wave of violence swept Ukrainian cities, including a series of high-profile and unpunished murders. One shudders at the memories of the terrible tragedy in Odessa, where peaceful protesters were brutally murdered, burned alive in the House of Trade Unions. The criminals who committed that atrocity have never been punished, and no one is even looking for them. But we know their names and we will do everything to punish them, find them and bring them to justice.\n\nMaidan did not bring Ukraine any closer to democracy and progress. Having accomplished a coup d'état, the nationalists and those political forces that supported them eventually led Ukraine into an impasse, pushed the country into the abyss of civil war. Eight years later, the country is split. Ukraine is struggling with an acute socioeconomic crisis.\n\nAccording to international organisations, in 2019, almost 6 million Ukrainians– I emphasise– about 15 percent, not of the wokrforce, but of the entire population of that country, had to go abroad to find work. Most of them do odd jobs. The following fact is also revealing: since 2020, over 60,000 doctors and other health workers have left the country amid the pandemic.\n\nSince 2014, water bills increased by almost a third, and energy bills grew several times, while the price of gas for households surged several dozen times. Many people simply do not have the money to pay for utilities. They literally struggle to survive.\n\nWhat happened? Why is this all happening? The answer is obvious. They spent and embezzled the legacy inherited not only from the Soviet era, but also from the Russian Empire. They lost tens, hundreds of thousands of jobs which enabled people to earn a reliable income and generate tax revenue, among other things thanks to close cooperation with Russia. Sectors including machine building, instrument engineering, electronics, ship and aircraft building have been undermined or destroyed altogether. There was a time, however, when not only Ukraine, but the entire Soviet Union took pride in these companies.\n\nIn 2021, the Black Sea Shipyard in Nikolayev went out of business. Its first docks date back to Catherine the Great. _Antonov_, the famous manufacturer, has not made a single commercial aircraft since 2016, while _Yuzhmash_, a factory specialising in missile and space equipment, is nearly bankrupt. The Kremenchug Steel Plant is in a similar situation. This sad list goes on and on.\n\nAs for the gas transportation system, it was built in its entirety by the Soviet Union, and it has now deteriorated to an extent that using it creates major risks and comes at a high cost for the environment.\n\nThis situation begs the question: poverty, lack of opportunity, and lost industrial and technological potential– is this the pro-Western civilisational choice they have been using for many years to fool millions of people with promises of heavenly pastures?\n\nIt all came down to a Ukrainian economy in tatters and an outright pillage of the country’s citizens, while Ukraine itself was placed under external control, directed not only from the Western capitals, but also on the ground, as the saying goes, through an entire network of foreign advisors, NGOs and other institutions present in Ukraine. They have a direct bearing on all the key appointments and dismissals and on all branches of power at all levels, from the central government down to municipalities, as well as on state-owned companies and corporations, including Naftogaz, Ukrenergo, Ukrainian Railways, Ukroboronprom, Ukrposhta, and the Ukrainian Sea Ports Authority.\n\nThere is no independent judiciary in Ukraine. The Kiev authorities, at the West’s demand, delegated the priority right to select members of the supreme judicial bodies, the Council of Justice and the High Qualifications Commission of Judges, to international organisations.\n\nIn addition, the United States directly controls the National Agency on Corruption Prevention, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau, the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office and the High Anti-Corruption Court. All this is done under the noble pretext of invigorating efforts against corruption. All right, but where are the results? Corruption is flourishing like never before.\n\nAre the Ukrainian people aware that this is how their country is managed? Do they realise that their country has turned not even into a political or economic protectorate but has been reduced to a colony with a puppet regime? The state was privatised. As a result, the government, which designates itself as the“power of patriots” no longer acts in a national capacity and consistently pushes Ukraine towards losing its sovereignty.\n\nThe policy to root out the Russian language and culture and promote assimilation carries on. The Verkhovna Rada has generated a steady flow of discriminatory bills, and the law on the so-called indigenous people has already come into force. People who identify as Russians and want to preserve their identity, language and culture are getting the signal that they are not wanted in Ukraine.\n\nUnder the laws on education and the Ukrainian language as a state language, the Russian language has no place in schools or public spaces, even in ordinary shops. The law on the so-called vetting of officials and purging their ranks created a pathway for dealing with unwanted civil servants.\n\nThere are more and more acts enabling the Ukrainian military and law enforcement agencies to crack down on the freedom of speech, dissent, and going after the opposition. The world knows the deplorable practice of imposing unilateral illegitimate sanctions against other countries, foreign individuals and legal entities. Ukraine has outperformed its Western masters by inventing sanctions against its own citizens, companies, television channels, other media outlets and even members of parliament.\n\nKiev continues to prepare the destruction of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate. This is not an emotional judgement; proof of this can be found in concrete decisions and documents. The Ukrainian authorities have cynically turned the tragedy of the schism into an instrument of state policy. The current authorities do not react to the Ukrainian people’s appeals to abolish the laws that are infringing on believers’ rights. Moreover, new draft laws directed against the clergy and millions of parishioners of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate have been registered in the Verkhovna Rada.\n\nA few words about Crimea. The people of the peninsula freely made their choice to be with Russia. The Kiev authorities cannot challenge the clearly stated choice of the people, which is why they have opted for aggressive action, for activating extremist cells, including radical Islamist organisations, for sending subversives to stage terrorist attacks at critical infrastructure facilities, and for kidnapping Russian citizens. We have factual proof that such aggressive actions are being taken with support from Western security services.\n\nIn March 2021, a new Military Strategy was adopted in Ukraine. This document is almost entirely dedicated to confrontation with Russia and sets the goal of involving foreign states in a conflict with our country. The strategy stipulates the organisation of what can be described as a terrorist underground movement in Russia’s Crimea and in Donbass. It also sets out the contours of a potential war, which should end, according to the Kiev strategists, “with the assistance of the international community on favourable terms for Ukraine,” as well as– listen carefully, please– “with foreign military support in the geopolitical confrontation with the Russian Federation.” In fact, this is nothing other than preparation for hostilities against our country, Russia.\n\nAs we know, it has already been stated today that Ukraine intends to create its own nuclear weapons, and this is not just bragging. Ukraine has the nuclear technologies created back in the Soviet times and delivery vehicles for such weapons, including aircraft, as well as the Soviet-designed Tochka-U precision tactical missiles with a range of over 100 kilometres. But they can do more; it is only a matter of time. They have had the groundwork for this since the Soviet era.\n\nIn other words, acquiring tactical nuclear weapons will be much easier for Ukraine than for some other states I am not going to mention here, which are conducting such research, especially if Kiev receives foreign technological support. We cannot rule this out either.\n\nIf Ukraine acquires weapons of mass destruction, the situation in the world and in Europe will drastically change, especially for us, for Russia. We cannot but react to this real danger, all the more so since, let me repeat, Ukraine’s Western patrons may help it acquire these weapons to create yet another threat to our country. We are seeing how persistently the Kiev regime is being pumped with arms. Since 2014, the United States alone has spent billions of dollars for this purpose, including supplies of arms and equipment and training of specialists. In the last few months, there has been a constant flow of Western weapons to Ukraine, ostentatiously, with the entire world watching. Foreign advisors supervise the activities of Ukraine’s armed forces and special services and we are well aware of this.\n\nOver the past few years, military contingents of NATO countries have been almost constantly present on Ukrainian territory under the pretext of exercises. The Ukrainian troop control system has already been integrated into NATO. This means that NATO headquarters can issue direct commands to the Ukrainian armed forces, even to their separate units and squads.\n\nThe United States and NATO have started an impudent development of Ukrainian territory as a theatre of potential military operations. Their regular joint exercises are obviously anti-Russian. Last year alone, over 23,000 troops and more than a thousand units of hardware were involved.\n\nA law has already been adopted that allows foreign troops to come to Ukraine in 2022 to take part in multinational drills. Understandably, these are primarily NATO troops. This year, at least ten of these joint drills are planned.\n\nObviously, such undertakings are designed to be a cover-up for a rapid buildup of the NATO military group on Ukrainian territory. This is all the more so since the network of airfields upgraded with US help in Borispol, Ivano-Frankovsk, Chuguyev and Odessa, to name a few, is capable of transferring army units in a very short time. Ukraine’s airspace is open to flights by US strategic and reconnaissance aircraft and drones that conduct surveillance over Russian territory.\n\nI will add that the US-built Maritime Operations Centre in Ochakov makes it possible to support activity by NATO warships, including the use of precision weapons, against the Russian Black Sea Fleet and our infrastructure on the entire Black Sea Coast.\n\nAt one time, the United States intended to build similar facilities in Crimea as well but the Crimeans and residents of Sevastopol wrecked these plans. We will always remember this.\n\nI would like to repeat that today such a centre has already been deployed in Ochakov. In the 18 th century, soldiers of Alexander Suvorov fought for this city. Owing to their courage, it became part of Russia. Also in the 18 th century, the lands of the Black Sea littoral, incorporated in Russia as a result of wars with the Ottoman Empire, were given the name of Novorossiya (New Russia). Now attempts are being made to condemn these landmarks of history to oblivion, along with the names of state and military figures of the Russian Empire without whose efforts modern Ukraine would not have many big cities or even access to the Black Sea.\n\nA monument to Alexander Suvorov was recently demolished in Poltava. What is there to say? Are you renouncing your own past? The so-called colonial heritage of the Russian Empire? Well, in this case, be consistent.\n\nNext, notably, Article 17 of the Constitution of Ukraine stipulates that deploying foreign military bases on its territory is illegal. However, as it turns out, this is just a conventionality that can be easily circumvented.\n\nUkraine is home to NATO training missions which are, in fact, foreign military bases. They just called a base a mission and were done with it.\n\nKiev has long proclaimed a strategic course on joining NATO. Indeed, each country is entitled to pick its own security system and enter into military alliances. There would be no problem with that, if it were not for one “but.” International documents expressly stipulate the principle of equal and indivisible security, which includes obligations not to strengthen one's own security at the expense of the security of other states. This is stated in the 1999 OSCE Charter for European Security adopted in Istanbul and the 2010 OSCE Astana Declaration.\n\nIn other words, the choice of pathways towards ensuring security should not pose a threat to other states, whereas Ukraine joining NATO is a direct threat to Russia's security.\n\nLet me remind you that at the Bucharest NATO summit held in April 2008, the United States pushed through a decision to the effect that Ukraine and, by the way, Georgia would become NATO members. Many European allies of the United States were well aware of the risks associated with this prospect already then, but were forced to put up with the will of their senior partner. The Americans simply used them to carry out a clearly anti-Russian policy.\n\nA number of NATO member states are still very sceptical about Ukraine joining NATO. We are getting signals from some European capitals telling us not to worry since it will not happen literally overnight. In fact, our US partners are saying the same thing as well. “All right, then” we respond, “if it does not happen tomorrow, then it will happen the day after tomorrow. What does it change from the historical perspective? Nothing at all.”\n\nFurthermore, we are aware of the US leadership’s position and words that active hostilities in eastern Ukraine do not rule out the possibility of that country joining NATO if it meets NATO criteria and overcomes corruption.\n\nAll the while, they are trying to convince us over and over again that NATO is a peace-loving and purely defensive alliance that poses no threat to Russia. Again, they want us to take their word for it. But we are well aware of the real value of these words. In 1990, when German unification was discussed, the United States promised the Soviet leadership that NATO jurisdiction or military presence will not expand one inch to the east and that the unification of Germany will not lead to the spread of NATO's military organisation to the east. This is a quote.\n\nThey issued lots of verbal assurances, all of which turned out to be empty phrases. Later, they began to assure us that the accession to NATO by Central and Eastern European countries would only improve relations with Moscow, relieve these countries of the fears steeped in their bitter historical legacy, and even create a belt of countries that are friendly towards Russia.\n\nHowever, the exact opposite happened. The governments of certain Eastern European countries, speculating on Russophobia, brought their complexes and stereotypes about the Russian threat to the Alliance and insisted on building up the collective defence potentials and deploying them primarily against Russia. Worse still, that happened in the 1990s and the early 2000s when, thanks to our openness and goodwill, relations between Russia and the West had reached a high level.\n\nRussia has fulfilled all of its obligations, including the pullout from Germany, from Central and Eastern Europe, making an immense contribution to overcoming the legacy of the Cold War. We have consistently proposed various cooperation options, including in the NATO-Russia Council and the OSCE formats.\n\nMoreover, I will say something I have never said publicly, I will say it now for the first time. When then outgoing US President Bill Clinton visited Moscow in 2000, I asked him how America would feel about admitting Russia to NATO.\n\nI will not reveal all the details of that conversation, but the reaction to my question was, let us say, quite restrained, and the Americans’ true attitude to that possibility can actually be seen from their subsequent steps with regard to our country. I am referring to the overt support for terrorists in the North Caucasus, the disregard for our security demands and concerns, NATO’s continued expansion, withdrawal from the ABM Treaty, and so on. It raises the question: why? What is all this about, what is the purpose? All right, you do not want to see us as friends or allies, but why make us an enemy?\n\nThere can be only one answer– this is not about our political regime or anything like that. They just do not need a big and independent country like Russia around. This is the answer to all questions. This is the source of America’s traditional policy towards Russia. Hence the attitude to all our security proposals\n\nToday, one glance at the map is enough to see to what extent Western countries have kept their promise to refrain from NATO’s eastward expansion. They just cheated. We have seen five waves of NATO expansion, one after another– Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary were admitted in 1999; Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia in 2004; Albania and Croatia in 2009; Montenegro in 2017; and North Macedonia in 2020.\n\nAs a result, the Alliance, its military infrastructure has reached Russia’s borders. This is one of the key causes of the European security crisis; it has had the most negative impact on the entire system of international relations and led to the loss of mutual trust.\n\nThe situation continues to deteriorate, including in the strategic area. Thus, positioning areas for interceptor missiles are being established in Romania and Poland as part of the US project to create a global missile defence system. It is common knowledge that the launchers deployed there can be used for Tomahawk cruise missiles– offensive strike systems.\n\nIn addition, the United States is developing its all-purpose Standard Missile-6, which can provide air and missile defence, as well as strike ground and surface targets. In other words, the allegedly defensive US missile defence system is developing and expanding its new offensive capabilities.\n\nThe information we have gives us good reason to believe that Ukraine’s accession to NATO and the subsequent deployment of NATO facilities has already been decided and is only a matter of time. We clearly understand that given this scenario, the level of military threats to Russia will increase dramatically, several times over. And I would like to emphasise at this point that the risk of a sudden strike at our country will multiply.\n\nI will explain that American strategic planning documents confirm the possibility of a so-called preemptive strike at enemy missile systems. We also know the main adversary of the United States and NATO. It is Russia. NATO documents officially declare our country to be the main threat to Euro-Atlantic security. Ukraine will serve as an advanced bridgehead for such a strike. If our ancestors heard about this, they would probably simply not believe this. We do not want to believe this today either, but it is what it is. I would like people in Russia and Ukraine to understand this.\n\nMany Ukrainian airfields are located not far from our borders. NATO’s tactical aviation deployed there, including precision weapon carriers, will be capable of striking at our territory to the depth of the Volgograd-Kazan-Samara-Astrakhan line. The deployment of reconnaissance radars on Ukrainian territory will allow NATO to tightly control Russia’s airspace up to the Urals.\n\nFinally, after the US destroyed the INF Treaty, the Pentagon has been openly developing many land-based attack weapons, including ballistic missiles that are capable of hitting targets at a distance of up to 5,500 km. If deployed in Ukraine, such systems will be able to hit targets in Russia’s entire European part. The flying time of Tomahawk cruise missiles to Moscow will be less than 35 minutes; ballistic missiles from Kharkov will take seven to eight minutes; and hypersonic assault weapons, four to five minutes. It is like a knife to the throat. I have no doubt that they hope to carry out these plans, as they did many times in the past, expanding NATO eastward, moving their military infrastructure to Russian borders and fully ignoring our concerns, protests and warnings. Excuse me, but they simply did not care at all about such things and did whatever they deemed necessary.\n\nOf course, they are going to behave in the same way in the future, following a well-known proverb: “The dogs bark but the caravan goes on.” Let me say right away– we do not accept this behaviour and will never accept it. That said, Russia has always advocated the resolution of the most complicated problems by political and diplomatic means, at the negotiating table.\n\nWe are well aware of our enormous responsibility when it comes to regional and global stability. Back in 2008, Russia put forth an initiative to conclude a European Security Treaty under which not a single Euro-Atlantic state or international organisation could strengthen their security at the expense of the security of others. However, our proposal was rejected right off the bat on the pretext that Russia should not be allowed to put limits on NATO activities.\n\nFurthermore, it was made explicitly clear to us that only NATO members can have legally binding security guarantees.\n\nLast December, we handed over to our Western partners a draft treaty between the Russian Federation and the United States of America on security guarantees, as well as a draft agreement on measures to ensure the security of the Russian Federation and NATO member states.\n\nThe United States and NATO responded with general statements. There were kernels of rationality in them as well, but they concerned matters of secondary importance and it all looked like an attempt to drag the issue out and to lead the discussion astray.\n\nWe responded to this accordingly and pointed out that we were ready to follow the path of negotiations, provided, however, that all issues are considered as a package that includes Russia’s core proposals which contain three key points. First, to prevent further NATO expansion. Second, to have the Alliance refrain from deploying assault weapon systems on Russian borders. And finally, rolling back the bloc's military capability and infrastructure in Europe to where they were in 1997, when the NATO-Russia Founding Act was signed.\n\nThese principled proposals of ours have been ignored. To reiterate, our Western partners have once again vocalised the all-too-familiar formulas that each state is entitled to freely choose ways to ensure its security or to join any military union or alliance. That is, nothing has changed in their stance, and we keep hearing the same old references to NATO’s notorious “open door” policy. Moreover, they are again trying to blackmail us and are threatening us with sanctions, which, by the way, they will introduce no matter what as Russia continues to strengthen its sovereignty and its Armed Forces. To be sure, they will never think twice before coming up with or just fabricating a pretext for yet another sanction attack regardless of the developments in Ukraine. Their one and only goal is to hold back the development of Russia. And they will keep doing so, just as they did before, even without any formal pretext just because we exist and will never compromise our sovereignty, national interests or values.\n\nI would like to be clear and straightforward: in the current circumstances, when our proposals for an equal dialogue on fundamental issues have actually remained unanswered by the United States and NATO, when the level of threats to our country has increased significantly, Russia has every right to respond in order to ensure its security. That is exactly what we will do.\n\nWith regard to the state of affairs in Donbass, we see that the ruling Kiev elites never stop publicly making clear their unwillingness to comply with the Minsk Package of Measures to settle the conflict and are not interested in a peaceful settlement. On the contrary, they are trying to orchestrate a blitzkrieg in Donbass as was the case in 2014 and 2015. We all know how these reckless schemes ended.\n\nNot a single day goes by without Donbass communities coming under shelling attacks. The recently formed large military force makes use of attack drones, heavy equipment, missiles, artillery and multiple rocket launchers. The killing of civilians, the blockade, the abuse of people, including children, women and the elderly, continues unabated. As we say, there is no end in sight to this.\n\nMeanwhile, the so-called civilised world, which our Western colleagues proclaimed themselves the only representatives of, prefers not to see this, as if this horror and genocide, which almost 4 million people are facing, do not exist. But they do exist and only because these people did not agree with the West-supported coup in Ukraine in 2014 and opposed the transition towards the Neanderthal and aggressive nationalism and neo-Nazism which have been elevated in Ukraine to the rank of national policy. They are fighting for their elementary right to live on their own land, to speak their own language, and to preserve their culture and traditions.\n\nHow long can this tragedy continue? How much longer can one put up with this? Russia has done everything to preserve Ukraine’s territorial integrity. All these years, it has persistently and patiently pushed for the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 2202 of February 17, 2015, which consolidated the Minsk Package of Measures of February 12, 2015, to settle the situation in Donbass.\n\nEverything was in vain. Presidents and Rada deputies come and go, but deep down the aggressive and nationalistic regime that seized power in Kiev remains unchanged. It is entirely a product of the 2014 coup, and those who then embarked on the path of violence, bloodshed and lawlessness did not recognise then and do not recognise now any solution to the Donbass issue other than a military one.\n\nIn this regard, I consider it necessary to take a long overdue decision and to immediately recognise the independence and sovereignty of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic.\n\nI would like to ask the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation to support this decision and then ratify the Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance with both republics. These two documents will be prepared and signed shortly.\n\nWe want those who seized and continue to hold power in Kiev to immediately stop hostilities. Otherwise, the responsibility for the possible continuation of the bloodshed will lie entirely on the conscience of Ukraine’s ruling regime.\n\nAs I announce the decisions taken today, I remain confident in the support of Russia’s citizens and the country’s patriotic forces.\n\nThank you."

        "full_text_segment": "So, I will start with the fact that modern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia or, to be more precise, by Bolshevik, Communist Russia. This process started practically right after the 1917 revolution, and Lenin and his associates did it in a way that was extremely harsh on Russia– by separating, severing what is historically Russian land. Nobody asked the millions of people living there what they thought.\n\nThen, both before and after the Great Patriotic War, Stalin incorporated in the USSR and transferred to Ukraine some lands that previously belonged to Poland, Romania and Hungary. In the process, he gave Poland part of what was traditionally German land as compensation, and in 1954, Khrushchev took Crimea away from Russia for some reason and also gave it to Ukraine. In effect, this is how the territory of modern Ukraine was formed.\n\nBut now I would like to focus attention on the initial period of the USSR’s formation. I believe this is extremely important for us. I will have to approach it from a distance, so to speak.\n\nI will remind you that after the 1917 October Revolution and the subsequent Civil War, the Bolsheviks set about creating a new statehood. They had rather serious disagreements among themselves on this point. In 1922, Stalin occupied the positions of both the General Secretary of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the People’s Commissar for Ethnic Affairs. He suggested building the country on the principles of autonomisation that is, giving the republics– the future administrative and territorial entities– broad powers upon joining a unified state.\n\nLenin criticised this plan and suggested making concessions to the nationalists, whom he called “independents” at that time. Lenin’s ideas of what amounted in essence to a confederative state arrangement and a slogan about the right of nations to self-determination, up to secession, were laid in the foundation of Soviet statehood. Initially they were confirmed in the Declaration on the Formation of the USSR in 1922, and later on, after Lenin’s death, were enshrined in the 1924 Soviet Constitution.\n\nThis immediately raises many questions. The first is really the main one: why was it necessary to appease the nationalists, to satisfy the ceaselessly growing nationalist ambitions on the outskirts of the former empire? What was the point of transferring to the newly, often arbitrarily formed administrative units– the union republics– vast territories that had nothing to do with them? Let me repeat that these territories were transferred along with the population of what was historically Russia.\n\nMoreover, these administrative units were de facto given the status and form of national state entities. That raises another question: why was it necessary to make such generous gifts, beyond the wildest dreams of the most zealous nationalists and, on top of all that, give the republics the right to secede from the unified state without any conditions?\n\nAt first glance, this looks absolutely incomprehensible, even crazy. But only at first glance. There is an explanation. After the revolution, the Bolsheviks’ main goal was to stay in power at all costs, absolutely at all costs. They did everything for this purpose: accepted the humiliating Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, although the military and economic situation in Kaiser Germany and its allies was dramatic and the outcome of the First World War was a foregone conclusion, and satisfied any demands and wishes of the nationalists within the country.\n\nWhen it comes to the historical destiny of Russia and its peoples, Lenin’s principles of state development were not just a mistake; they were worse than a mistake, as the saying goes. This became patently clear after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nOf course, we cannot change past events, but we must at least admit them openly and honestly, without any reservations or politicking. Personally, I can add that no political factors, however impressive or profitable they may seem at any given moment, can or may be used as the fundamental principles of statehood.\n\nI am not trying to put the blame on anyone. The situation in the country at that time, both before and after the Civil War, was extremely complicated; it was critical. The only thing I would like to say today is that this is exactly how it was. It is a historical fact. Actually, as I have already said, Soviet Ukraine is the result of the Bolsheviks’ policy and can be rightfully called “Vladimir Lenin’s Ukraine.” He was its creator and architect."

The deployment of reconnaissance radars on Ukrainian territory will allow NATO to tightly control Russia’s airspace up to the Urals.\n\nFinally, after the US destroyed the INF Treaty, the Pentagon has been openly developing many land-based attack weapons, including ballistic missiles that are capable of hitting targets at a distance of up to 5,500 km. If deployed in Ukraine, such systems will be able to hit targets in Russia’s entire European part. The flying time of Tomahawk cruise missiles to Moscow will be less than 35 minutes; ballistic missiles from Kharkov will take seven to eight minutes; and hypersonic assault weapons, four to five minutes. It is like a knife to the throat. I have no doubt that they hope to carry out these plans, as they did many times in the past, expanding NATO eastward, moving their military infrastructure to Russian borders and fully ignoring our concerns, protests and warnings. Excuse me, but they simply did not care at all about such things and did whatever they deemed necessary.\n\nOf course, they are going to behave in the same way in the future, following a well-known proverb: “The dogs bark but the caravan goes on.” Let me say right away– we do not accept this behaviour and will never accept it. That said, Russia has always advocated the resolution of the most complicated problems by political and diplomatic means, at the negotiating table.\n\nWe are well aware of our enormous responsibility when it comes to regional and global stability. Back in 2008, Russia put forth an initiative to conclude a European Security Treaty under which not a single Euro-Atlantic state or international organisation could strengthen their security at the expense of the security of others. However, our proposal was rejected right off the bat on the pretext that Russia should not be allowed to put limits on NATO activities.\n\nFurthermore, it was made explicitly clear to us that only NATO members can have legally binding security guarantees.\n\nLast December, we handed over to our Western partners a draft treaty between the Russian Federation and the United States of America on security guarantees, as well as a draft agreement on measures to ensure the security of the Russian Federation and NATO member states.\n\nThe United States and NATO responded with general statements. There were kernels of rationality in them as well, but they concerned matters of secondary importance and it all looked like an attempt to drag the issue out and to lead the discussion astray.\n\nWe responded to this accordingly and pointed out that we were ready to follow the path of negotiations, provided, however, that all issues are considered as a package that includes Russia’s core proposals which contain three key points. First, to prevent further NATO expansion. Second, to have the Alliance refrain from deploying assault weapon systems on Russian borders. And finally, rolling back the bloc's military capability and infrastructure in Europe to where they were in 1997, when the NATO-Russia Founding Act was signed.\n\nThese principled proposals of ours have been ignored."

    "full_text": "**President of Russia Vladimir Putin:** Citizens of Russia, friends,\n\nMy address concerns the events in Ukraine and why this is so important for us, for Russia. Of course, my message is also addressed to our compatriots in Ukraine.\n\nThe matter is very serious and needs to be discussed in depth.\n\nThe situation in Donbass has reached a critical, acute stage. I am speaking to you directly today not only to explain what is happening but also to inform you of the decisions being made as well as potential further steps.\n\nI would like to emphasise again that Ukraine is not just a neighbouring country for us. It is an inalienable part of our own history, culture and spiritual space. These are our comrades, those dearest to us– not only colleagues, friends and people who once served together, but also relatives, people bound by blood, by family ties.\n\nSince time immemorial, the people living in the south-west of what has historically been Russian land have called themselves Russians and Orthodox Christians. This was the case before the 17 th century, when a portion of this territory rejoined the Russian state, and after.\n\nIt seems to us that, generally speaking, we all know these facts, that this is common knowledge. Still, it is necessary to say at least a few words about the history of this issue in order to understand what is happening today, to explain the motives behind Russia’s actions and what we aim to achieve.\n\nSo, I will start with the fact that modern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia or, to be more precise, by Bolshevik, Communist Russia. This process started practically right after the 1917 revolution, and Lenin and his associates did it in a way that was extremely harsh on Russia– by separating, severing what is historically Russian land. Nobody asked the millions of people living there what they thought.\n\nThen, both before and after the Great Patriotic War, Stalin incorporated in the USSR and transferred to Ukraine some lands that previously belonged to Poland, Romania and Hungary. In the process, he gave Poland part of what was traditionally German land as compensation, and in 1954, Khrushchev took Crimea away from Russia for some reason and also gave it to Ukraine. In effect, this is how the territory of modern Ukraine was formed.\n\nBut now I would like to focus attention on the initial period of the USSR’s formation. I believe this is extremely important for us. I will have to approach it from a distance, so to speak.\n\nI will remind you that after the 1917 October Revolution and the subsequent Civil War, the Bolsheviks set about creating a new statehood. They had rather serious disagreements among themselves on this point. In 1922, Stalin occupied the positions of both the General Secretary of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the People’s Commissar for Ethnic Affairs. He suggested building the country on the principles of autonomisation that is, giving the republics– the future administrative and territorial entities– broad powers upon joining a unified state.\n\nLenin criticised this plan and suggested making concessions to the nationalists, whom he called “independents” at that time. Lenin’s ideas of what amounted in essence to a confederative state arrangement and a slogan about the right of nations to self-determination, up to secession, were laid in the foundation of Soviet statehood. Initially they were confirmed in the Declaration on the Formation of the USSR in 1922, and later on, after Lenin’s death, were enshrined in the 1924 Soviet Constitution.\n\nThis immediately raises many questions. The first is really the main one: why was it necessary to appease the nationalists, to satisfy the ceaselessly growing nationalist ambitions on the outskirts of the former empire? What was the point of transferring to the newly, often arbitrarily formed administrative units– the union republics– vast territories that had nothing to do with them? Let me repeat that these territories were transferred along with the population of what was historically Russia.\n\nMoreover, these administrative units were de facto given the status and form of national state entities. That raises another question: why was it necessary to make such generous gifts, beyond the wildest dreams of the most zealous nationalists and, on top of all that, give the republics the right to secede from the unified state without any conditions?\n\nAt first glance, this looks absolutely incomprehensible, even crazy. But only at first glance. There is an explanation. After the revolution, the Bolsheviks’ main goal was to stay in power at all costs, absolutely at all costs. They did everything for this purpose: accepted the humiliating Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, although the military and economic situation in Kaiser Germany and its allies was dramatic and the outcome of the First World War was a foregone conclusion, and satisfied any demands and wishes of the nationalists within the country.\n\nWhen it comes to the historical destiny of Russia and its peoples, Lenin’s principles of state development were not just a mistake; they were worse than a mistake, as the saying goes. This became patently clear after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nOf course, we cannot change past events, but we must at least admit them openly and honestly, without any reservations or politicking. Personally, I can add that no political factors, however impressive or profitable they may seem at any given moment, can or may be used as the fundamental principles of statehood.\n\nI am not trying to put the blame on anyone. The situation in the country at that time, both before and after the Civil War, was extremely complicated; it was critical. The only thing I would like to say today is that this is exactly how it was. It is a historical fact. Actually, as I have already said, Soviet Ukraine is the result of the Bolsheviks’ policy and can be rightfully called “Vladimir Lenin’s Ukraine.” He was its creator and architect. This is fully and comprehensively corroborated by archival documents, including Lenin’s harsh instructions regarding Donbass, which was actually shoved into Ukraine. And today the“grateful progeny” has overturned monuments to Lenin in Ukraine. They call it decommunization.\n\nYou want decommunization? Very well, this suits us just fine. But why stop halfway? We are ready to show what real decommunizations would mean for Ukraine.\n\nGoing back to history, I would like to repeat that the Soviet Union was established in the place of the former Russian Empire in 1922. But practice showed immediately that it was impossible to preserve or govern such a vast and complex territory on the amorphous principles that amounted to confederation. They were far removed from reality and the historical tradition.\n\nIt is logical that the Red Terror and a rapid slide into Stalin’s dictatorship, the domination of the communist ideology and the Communist Party’s monopoly on power, nationalisation and the planned economy– all this transformed the formally declared but ineffective principles of government into a mere declaration. In reality, the union republics did not have any sovereign rights, none at all. The practical result was the creation of a tightly centralised and absolutely unitary state.\n\nIn fact, what Stalin fully implemented was not Lenin’s but his own principles of government. But he did not make the relevant amendments to the cornerstone documents, to the Constitution, and he did not formally revise Lenin’s principles underlying the Soviet Union. From the look of it, there seemed to be no need for that, because everything seemed to be working well in conditions of the totalitarian regime, and outwardly it looked wonderful, attractive and even super-democratic.\n\nAnd yet, it is a great pity that the fundamental and formally legal foundations of our state were not promptly cleansed of the odious and utopian fantasies inspired by the revolution, which are absolutely destructive for any normal state. As it often happened in our country before, nobody gave any thought to the future.\n\nIt seems that the Communist Party leaders were convinced that they had created a solid system of government and that their policies had settled the ethnic issue for good. But falsification, misconception, and tampering with public opinion have a high cost. The virus of nationalist ambitions is still with us, and the mine laid at the initial stage to destroy state immunity to the disease of nationalism was ticking. As I have already said, the mine was the right of secession from the Soviet Union.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the increasing socioeconomic problems and the apparent crisis of the planned economy aggravated the ethnic issue, which essentially was not based on any expectations or unfulfilled dreams of the Soviet peoples but primarily the growing appetites of the local elites.\n\nHowever, instead of analysing the situation, taking appropriate measures, first of all in the economy, and gradually transforming the political system and government in a well-considered and balanced manner, the Communist Party leadership only engaged in open doubletalk about the revival of the Leninist principle of national self-determination.\n\nMoreover, in the course of power struggle within the Communist Party itself, each of the opposing sides, in a bid to expand its support base, started to thoughtlessly incite and encourage nationalist sentiments, manipulating them and promising their potential supporters whatever they wished. Against the backdrop of the superficial and populist rhetoric about democracy and a bright future based either on a market or a planned economy, but amid a true impoverishment of people and widespread shortages, no one among the powers that be was thinking about the inevitable tragic consequences for the country.\n\nNext, they entirely embarked on the track beaten at the inception of the USSR and pandering to the ambitions of the nationalist elites nurtured within their own party ranks. But in so doing, they forgot that the CPSU no longer had– thank God– the tools for retaining power and the country itself, tools such as state terror and a Stalinist-type dictatorship, and that the notorious guiding role of the party was disappearing without a trace, like a morning mist, right before their eyes.\n\nAnd then, the September 1989 plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee approved a truly fatal document, the so-called ethnic policy of the party in modern conditions, the CPSU platform. It included the following provisions, I quote: “The republics of the USSR shall possess all the rights appropriate to their status as sovereign socialist states.”\n\nThe next point: “The supreme representative bodies of power of the USSR republics can challenge and suspend the operation of the USSR Government’s resolutions and directives in their territory.”\n\nAnd finally: “Each republic of the USSR shall have citizenship of its own, which shall apply to all of its residents.”\n\nWasn’t it clear what these formulas and decisions would lead to?\n\nNow is not the time or place to go into matters pertaining to state or constitutional law, or define the concept of citizenship. But one may wonder: why was it necessary to rock the country even more in that already complicated situation? The facts remain.\n\nEven two years before the collapse of the USSR, its fate was actually predetermined. It is now that radicals and nationalists, including and primarily those in Ukraine, are taking credit for having gained independence. As we can see, this is absolutely wrong. The disintegration of our united country was brought about by the historic, strategic mistakes on the part of the Bolshevik leaders and the CPSU leadership, mistakes committed at different times in state-building and in economic and ethnic policies. The collapse of the historical Russia known as the USSR is on their conscience.\n\nDespite all these injustices, lies and outright pillage of Russia, it was our people who accepted the new geopolitical reality that took shape after the dissolution of the USSR, and recognised the new independent states. Not only did Russia recognise these countries, but helped its CIS partners, even though it faced a very dire situation itself. This included our Ukrainian colleagues, who turned to us for financial support many times from the very moment they declared independence. Our country provided this assistance while respecting Ukraine’s dignity and sovereignty.\n\nAccording to expert assessments, confirmed by a simple calculation of our energy prices, the subsidised loans Russia provided to Ukraine along with economic and trade preferences, the overall benefit for the Ukrainian budget in the period from 1991 to 2013 amounted to$250 billion.\n\nHowever, there was more to it than that. By the end of 1991, the USSR owed some $100 billion to other countries and international funds. Initially, there was this idea that all former Soviet republics will pay back these loans together, in the spirit of solidarity and proportionally to their economic potential. However, Russia undertook to pay back all Soviet debts and delivered on this promise by completing this process in 2017.\n\nIn exchange for that, the newly independent states had to hand over to Russia part of the Soviet foreign assets. An agreement to this effect was reached with Ukraine in December 1994. However, Kiev failed to ratify these agreements and later simply refused to honour them by making demands for a share of the Diamond Treasury, gold reserves, as well as former USSR property and other assets abroad.\n\nNevertheless, despite all these challenges, Russia always worked with Ukraine in an open and honest manner and, as I have already said, with respect for its interests. We developed our ties in multiple fields. Thus, in 2011, bilateral trade exceeded $50 billion. Let me note that in 2019, that is before the pandemic, Ukraine’s trade with all EU countries combined was below this indicator.\n\nAt the same time, it was striking how the Ukrainian authorities always preferred dealing with Russia in a way that ensured that they enjoy all the rights and privileges while remaining free from any obligations.\n\nThe officials in Kiev replaced partnership with a parasitic attitude acting at times in an extremely brash manner. Suffice it to recall the continuous blackmail on energy transits and the fact that they literally stole gas.\n\nI can add that Kiev tried to use dialogue with Russia as a bargaining chip in its relations with the West, using the threat of closer ties with Russia for blackmailing the West to secure preferences by claiming that otherwise Russia would have a bigger influence in Ukraine.\n\nAt the same time, the Ukrainian authorities– I would like to emphasise this– began by building their statehood on the negation of everything that united us, trying to distort the mentality and historical memory of millions of people, of entire generations living in Ukraine. It is not surprising that Ukrainian society was faced with the rise of far-right nationalism, which rapidly developed into aggressive Russophobia and neo-Nazism. This resulted in the participation of Ukrainian nationalists and neo-Nazis in the terrorist groups in the North Caucasus and the increasingly loud territorial claims to Russia.\n\nA role in this was played by external forces, which used a ramified network of NGOs and special services to nurture their clients in Ukraine and to bring their representatives to the seats of authority.\n\nIt should be noted that Ukraine actually never had stable traditions of real statehood. And, therefore, in 1991 it opted for mindlessly emulating foreign models, which have no relation to history or Ukrainian realities. Political government institutions were readjusted many times to the rapidly growing clans and their self-serving interests, which had nothing to do with the interests of the Ukrainian people.\n\nEssentially, the so-called pro-Western civilisational choice made by the oligarchic Ukrainian authorities was not and is not aimed at creating better conditions in the interests of people’s well-being but at keeping the billions of dollars that the oligarchs have stolen from the Ukrainians and are holding in their accounts in Western banks, while reverently accommodating the geopolitical rivals of Russia.\n\nSome industrial and financial groups and the parties and politicians on their payroll relied on the nationalists and radicals from the very beginning. Others claimed to be in favour of good relations with Russia and cultural and language diversity, coming to power with the help of their citizens who sincerely supported their declared aspirations, including the millions of people in the south-eastern regions. But after getting the positions they coveted, these people immediately betrayed their voters, going back on their election promises and instead steering a policy prompted by the radicals and sometimes even persecuting their former allies– the public organisations that supported bilingualism and cooperation with Russia. These people took advantage of the fact that their voters were mostly law-abiding citizens with moderate views who trusted the authorities, and that, unlike the radicals, they would not act aggressively or make use of illegal instruments.\n\nMeanwhile, the radicals became increasingly brazen in their actions and made more demands every year. They found it easy to force their will on the weak authorities, which were infected with the virus of nationalism and corruption as well and which artfully replaced the real cultural, economic and social interests of the people and Ukraine’s true sovereignty with various ethnic speculations and formal ethnic attributes.\n\nA stable statehood has never developed in Ukraine; its electoral and other political procedures just serve as a cover, a screen for the redistribution of power and property between various oligarchic clans.\n\nCorruption, which is certainly a challenge and a problem for many countries, including Russia, has gone beyond the usual scope in Ukraine. It has literally permeated and corroded Ukrainian statehood, the entire system, and all branches of power.\n\nRadical nationalists took advantage of the justified public discontent and saddled the Maidan protest, escalating it to a coup d'état in 2014. They also had direct assistance from foreign states. According to reports, the US Embassy provided $1 million a day to support the so-called protest camp on Independence Square in Kiev. In addition, large amounts were impudently transferred directly to the opposition leaders’ bank accounts, tens of millions of dollars. But the people who actually suffered, the families of those who died in the clashes provoked in the streets and squares of Kiev and other cities, how much did they get in the end? Better not ask.\n\nThe nationalists who have seized power have unleashed a persecution, a real terror campaign against those who opposed their anti-constitutional actions. Politicians, journalists, and public activists were harassed and publicly humiliated. A wave of violence swept Ukrainian cities, including a series of high-profile and unpunished murders. One shudders at the memories of the terrible tragedy in Odessa, where peaceful protesters were brutally murdered, burned alive in the House of Trade Unions. The criminals who committed that atrocity have never been punished, and no one is even looking for them. But we know their names and we will do everything to punish them, find them and bring them to justice.\n\nMaidan did not bring Ukraine any closer to democracy and progress. Having accomplished a coup d'état, the nationalists and those political forces that supported them eventually led Ukraine into an impasse, pushed the country into the abyss of civil war. Eight years later, the country is split. Ukraine is struggling with an acute socioeconomic crisis.\n\nAccording to international organisations, in 2019, almost 6 million Ukrainians– I emphasise– about 15 percent, not of the wokrforce, but of the entire population of that country, had to go abroad to find work. Most of them do odd jobs. The following fact is also revealing: since 2020, over 60,000 doctors and other health workers have left the country amid the pandemic.\n\nSince 2014, water bills increased by almost a third, and energy bills grew several times, while the price of gas for households surged several dozen times. Many people simply do not have the money to pay for utilities. They literally struggle to survive.\n\nWhat happened? Why is this all happening? The answer is obvious. They spent and embezzled the legacy inherited not only from the Soviet era, but also from the Russian Empire. They lost tens, hundreds of thousands of jobs which enabled people to earn a reliable income and generate tax revenue, among other things thanks to close cooperation with Russia. Sectors including machine building, instrument engineering, electronics, ship and aircraft building have been undermined or destroyed altogether. There was a time, however, when not only Ukraine, but the entire Soviet Union took pride in these companies.\n\nIn 2021, the Black Sea Shipyard in Nikolayev went out of business. Its first docks date back to Catherine the Great. _Antonov_, the famous manufacturer, has not made a single commercial aircraft since 2016, while _Yuzhmash_, a factory specialising in missile and space equipment, is nearly bankrupt. The Kremenchug Steel Plant is in a similar situation. This sad list goes on and on.\n\nAs for the gas transportation system, it was built in its entirety by the Soviet Union, and it has now deteriorated to an extent that using it creates major risks and comes at a high cost for the environment.\n\nThis situation begs the question: poverty, lack of opportunity, and lost industrial and technological potential– is this the pro-Western civilisational choice they have been using for many years to fool millions of people with promises of heavenly pastures?\n\nIt all came down to a Ukrainian economy in tatters and an outright pillage of the country’s citizens, while Ukraine itself was placed under external control, directed not only from the Western capitals, but also on the ground, as the saying goes, through an entire network of foreign advisors, NGOs and other institutions present in Ukraine. They have a direct bearing on all the key appointments and dismissals and on all branches of power at all levels, from the central government down to municipalities, as well as on state-owned companies and corporations, including Naftogaz, Ukrenergo, Ukrainian Railways, Ukroboronprom, Ukrposhta, and the Ukrainian Sea Ports Authority.\n\nThere is no independent judiciary in Ukraine. The Kiev authorities, at the West’s demand, delegated the priority right to select members of the supreme judicial bodies, the Council of Justice and the High Qualifications Commission of Judges, to international organisations.\n\nIn addition, the United States directly controls the National Agency on Corruption Prevention, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau, the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office and the High Anti-Corruption Court. All this is done under the noble pretext of invigorating efforts against corruption. All right, but where are the results? Corruption is flourishing like never before.\n\nAre the Ukrainian people aware that this is how their country is managed? Do they realise that their country has turned not even into a political or economic protectorate but has been reduced to a colony with a puppet regime? The state was privatised. As a result, the government, which designates itself as the“power of patriots” no longer acts in a national capacity and consistently pushes Ukraine towards losing its sovereignty.\n\nThe policy to root out the Russian language and culture and promote assimilation carries on. The Verkhovna Rada has generated a steady flow of discriminatory bills, and the law on the so-called indigenous people has already come into force. People who identify as Russians and want to preserve their identity, language and culture are getting the signal that they are not wanted in Ukraine.\n\nUnder the laws on education and the Ukrainian language as a state language, the Russian language has no place in schools or public spaces, even in ordinary shops. The law on the so-called vetting of officials and purging their ranks created a pathway for dealing with unwanted civil servants.\n\nThere are more and more acts enabling the Ukrainian military and law enforcement agencies to crack down on the freedom of speech, dissent, and going after the opposition. The world knows the deplorable practice of imposing unilateral illegitimate sanctions against other countries, foreign individuals and legal entities. Ukraine has outperformed its Western masters by inventing sanctions against its own citizens, companies, television channels, other media outlets and even members of parliament.\n\nKiev continues to prepare the destruction of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate. This is not an emotional judgement; proof of this can be found in concrete decisions and documents. The Ukrainian authorities have cynically turned the tragedy of the schism into an instrument of state policy. The current authorities do not react to the Ukrainian people’s appeals to abolish the laws that are infringing on believers’ rights. Moreover, new draft laws directed against the clergy and millions of parishioners of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate have been registered in the Verkhovna Rada.\n\nA few words about Crimea. The people of the peninsula freely made their choice to be with Russia. The Kiev authorities cannot challenge the clearly stated choice of the people, which is why they have opted for aggressive action, for activating extremist cells, including radical Islamist organisations, for sending subversives to stage terrorist attacks at critical infrastructure facilities, and for kidnapping Russian citizens. We have factual proof that such aggressive actions are being taken with support from Western security services.\n\nIn March 2021, a new Military Strategy was adopted in Ukraine. This document is almost entirely dedicated to confrontation with Russia and sets the goal of involving foreign states in a conflict with our country. The strategy stipulates the organisation of what can be described as a terrorist underground movement in Russia’s Crimea and in Donbass. It also sets out the contours of a potential war, which should end, according to the Kiev strategists, “with the assistance of the international community on favourable terms for Ukraine,” as well as– listen carefully, please– “with foreign military support in the geopolitical confrontation with the Russian Federation.” In fact, this is nothing other than preparation for hostilities against our country, Russia.\n\nAs we know, it has already been stated today that Ukraine intends to create its own nuclear weapons, and this is not just bragging. Ukraine has the nuclear technologies created back in the Soviet times and delivery vehicles for such weapons, including aircraft, as well as the Soviet-designed Tochka-U precision tactical missiles with a range of over 100 kilometres. But they can do more; it is only a matter of time. They have had the groundwork for this since the Soviet era.\n\nIn other words, acquiring tactical nuclear weapons will be much easier for Ukraine than for some other states I am not going to mention here, which are conducting such research, especially if Kiev receives foreign technological support. We cannot rule this out either.\n\nIf Ukraine acquires weapons of mass destruction, the situation in the world and in Europe will drastically change, especially for us, for Russia. We cannot but react to this real danger, all the more so since, let me repeat, Ukraine’s Western patrons may help it acquire these weapons to create yet another threat to our country. We are seeing how persistently the Kiev regime is being pumped with arms. Since 2014, the United States alone has spent billions of dollars for this purpose, including supplies of arms and equipment and training of specialists. In the last few months, there has been a constant flow of Western weapons to Ukraine, ostentatiously, with the entire world watching. Foreign advisors supervise the activities of Ukraine’s armed forces and special services and we are well aware of this.\n\nOver the past few years, military contingents of NATO countries have been almost constantly present on Ukrainian territory under the pretext of exercises. The Ukrainian troop control system has already been integrated into NATO. This means that NATO headquarters can issue direct commands to the Ukrainian armed forces, even to their separate units and squads.\n\nThe United States and NATO have started an impudent development of Ukrainian territory as a theatre of potential military operations. Their regular joint exercises are obviously anti-Russian. Last year alone, over 23,000 troops and more than a thousand units of hardware were involved.\n\nA law has already been adopted that allows foreign troops to come to Ukraine in 2022 to take part in multinational drills. Understandably, these are primarily NATO troops. This year, at least ten of these joint drills are planned.\n\nObviously, such undertakings are designed to be a cover-up for a rapid buildup of the NATO military group on Ukrainian territory. This is all the more so since the network of airfields upgraded with US help in Borispol, Ivano-Frankovsk, Chuguyev and Odessa, to name a few, is capable of transferring army units in a very short time. Ukraine’s airspace is open to flights by US strategic and reconnaissance aircraft and drones that conduct surveillance over Russian territory.\n\nI will add that the US-built Maritime Operations Centre in Ochakov makes it possible to support activity by NATO warships, including the use of precision weapons, against the Russian Black Sea Fleet and our infrastructure on the entire Black Sea Coast.\n\nAt one time, the United States intended to build similar facilities in Crimea as well but the Crimeans and residents of Sevastopol wrecked these plans. We will always remember this.\n\nI would like to repeat that today such a centre has already been deployed in Ochakov. In the 18 th century, soldiers of Alexander Suvorov fought for this city. Owing to their courage, it became part of Russia. Also in the 18 th century, the lands of the Black Sea littoral, incorporated in Russia as a result of wars with the Ottoman Empire, were given the name of Novorossiya (New Russia). Now attempts are being made to condemn these landmarks of history to oblivion, along with the names of state and military figures of the Russian Empire without whose efforts modern Ukraine would not have many big cities or even access to the Black Sea.\n\nA monument to Alexander Suvorov was recently demolished in Poltava. What is there to say? Are you renouncing your own past? The so-called colonial heritage of the Russian Empire? Well, in this case, be consistent.\n\nNext, notably, Article 17 of the Constitution of Ukraine stipulates that deploying foreign military bases on its territory is illegal. However, as it turns out, this is just a conventionality that can be easily circumvented.\n\nUkraine is home to NATO training missions which are, in fact, foreign military bases. They just called a base a mission and were done with it.\n\nKiev has long proclaimed a strategic course on joining NATO. Indeed, each country is entitled to pick its own security system and enter into military alliances. There would be no problem with that, if it were not for one “but.” International documents expressly stipulate the principle of equal and indivisible security, which includes obligations not to strengthen one's own security at the expense of the security of other states. This is stated in the 1999 OSCE Charter for European Security adopted in Istanbul and the 2010 OSCE Astana Declaration.\n\nIn other words, the choice of pathways towards ensuring security should not pose a threat to other states, whereas Ukraine joining NATO is a direct threat to Russia's security.\n\nLet me remind you that at the Bucharest NATO summit held in April 2008, the United States pushed through a decision to the effect that Ukraine and, by the way, Georgia would become NATO members. Many European allies of the United States were well aware of the risks associated with this prospect already then, but were forced to put up with the will of their senior partner. The Americans simply used them to carry out a clearly anti-Russian policy.\n\nA number of NATO member states are still very sceptical about Ukraine joining NATO. We are getting signals from some European capitals telling us not to worry since it will not happen literally overnight. In fact, our US partners are saying the same thing as well. “All right, then” we respond, “if it does not happen tomorrow, then it will happen the day after tomorrow. What does it change from the historical perspective? Nothing at all.”\n\nFurthermore, we are aware of the US leadership’s position and words that active hostilities in eastern Ukraine do not rule out the possibility of that country joining NATO if it meets NATO criteria and overcomes corruption.\n\nAll the while, they are trying to convince us over and over again that NATO is a peace-loving and purely defensive alliance that poses no threat to Russia. Again, they want us to take their word for it. But we are well aware of the real value of these words. In 1990, when German unification was discussed, the United States promised the Soviet leadership that NATO jurisdiction or military presence will not expand one inch to the east and that the unification of Germany will not lead to the spread of NATO's military organisation to the east. This is a quote.\n\nThey issued lots of verbal assurances, all of which turned out to be empty phrases. Later, they began to assure us that the accession to NATO by Central and Eastern European countries would only improve relations with Moscow, relieve these countries of the fears steeped in their bitter historical legacy, and even create a belt of countries that are friendly towards Russia.\n\nHowever, the exact opposite happened. The governments of certain Eastern European countries, speculating on Russophobia, brought their complexes and stereotypes about the Russian threat to the Alliance and insisted on building up the collective defence potentials and deploying them primarily against Russia. Worse still, that happened in the 1990s and the early 2000s when, thanks to our openness and goodwill, relations between Russia and the West had reached a high level.\n\nRussia has fulfilled all of its obligations, including the pullout from Germany, from Central and Eastern Europe, making an immense contribution to overcoming the legacy of the Cold War. We have consistently proposed various cooperation options, including in the NATO-Russia Council and the OSCE formats.\n\nMoreover, I will say something I have never said publicly, I will say it now for the first time. When then outgoing US President Bill Clinton visited Moscow in 2000, I asked him how America would feel about admitting Russia to NATO.\n\nI will not reveal all the details of that conversation, but the reaction to my question was, let us say, quite restrained, and the Americans’ true attitude to that possibility can actually be seen from their subsequent steps with regard to our country. I am referring to the overt support for terrorists in the North Caucasus, the disregard for our security demands and concerns, NATO’s continued expansion, withdrawal from the ABM Treaty, and so on. It raises the question: why? What is all this about, what is the purpose? All right, you do not want to see us as friends or allies, but why make us an enemy?\n\nThere can be only one answer– this is not about our political regime or anything like that. They just do not need a big and independent country like Russia around. This is the answer to all questions. This is the source of America’s traditional policy towards Russia. Hence the attitude to all our security proposals\n\nToday, one glance at the map is enough to see to what extent Western countries have kept their promise to refrain from NATO’s eastward expansion. They just cheated. We have seen five waves of NATO expansion, one after another– Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary were admitted in 1999; Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia in 2004; Albania and Croatia in 2009; Montenegro in 2017; and North Macedonia in 2020.\n\nAs a result, the Alliance, its military infrastructure has reached Russia’s borders. This is one of the key causes of the European security crisis; it has had the most negative impact on the entire system of international relations and led to the loss of mutual trust.\n\nThe situation continues to deteriorate, including in the strategic area. Thus, positioning areas for interceptor missiles are being established in Romania and Poland as part of the US project to create a global missile defence system. It is common knowledge that the launchers deployed there can be used for Tomahawk cruise missiles– offensive strike systems.\n\nIn addition, the United States is developing its all-purpose Standard Missile-6, which can provide air and missile defence, as well as strike ground and surface targets. In other words, the allegedly defensive US missile defence system is developing and expanding its new offensive capabilities.\n\nThe information we have gives us good reason to believe that Ukraine’s accession to NATO and the subsequent deployment of NATO facilities has already been decided and is only a matter of time. We clearly understand that given this scenario, the level of military threats to Russia will increase dramatically, several times over. And I would like to emphasise at this point that the risk of a sudden strike at our country will multiply.\n\nI will explain that American strategic planning documents confirm the possibility of a so-called preemptive strike at enemy missile systems. We also know the main adversary of the United States and NATO. It is Russia. NATO documents officially declare our country to be the main threat to Euro-Atlantic security. Ukraine will serve as an advanced bridgehead for such a strike. If our ancestors heard about this, they would probably simply not believe this. We do not want to believe this today either, but it is what it is. I would like people in Russia and Ukraine to understand this.\n\nMany Ukrainian airfields are located not far from our borders. NATO’s tactical aviation deployed there, including precision weapon carriers, will be capable of striking at our territory to the depth of the Volgograd-Kazan-Samara-Astrakhan line. The deployment of reconnaissance radars on Ukrainian territory will allow NATO to tightly control Russia’s airspace up to the Urals.\n\nFinally, after the US destroyed the INF Treaty, the Pentagon has been openly developing many land-based attack weapons, including ballistic missiles that are capable of hitting targets at a distance of up to 5,500 km. If deployed in Ukraine, such systems will be able to hit targets in Russia’s entire European part. The flying time of Tomahawk cruise missiles to Moscow will be less than 35 minutes; ballistic missiles from Kharkov will take seven to eight minutes; and hypersonic assault weapons, four to five minutes. It is like a knife to the throat. I have no doubt that they hope to carry out these plans, as they did many times in the past, expanding NATO eastward, moving their military infrastructure to Russian borders and fully ignoring our concerns, protests and warnings. Excuse me, but they simply did not care at all about such things and did whatever they deemed necessary.\n\nOf course, they are going to behave in the same way in the future, following a well-known proverb: “The dogs bark but the caravan goes on.” Let me say right away– we do not accept this behaviour and will never accept it. That said, Russia has always advocated the resolution of the most complicated problems by political and diplomatic means, at the negotiating table.\n\nWe are well aware of our enormous responsibility when it comes to regional and global stability. Back in 2008, Russia put forth an initiative to conclude a European Security Treaty under which not a single Euro-Atlantic state or international organisation could strengthen their security at the expense of the security of others. However, our proposal was rejected right off the bat on the pretext that Russia should not be allowed to put limits on NATO activities.\n\nFurthermore, it was made explicitly clear to us that only NATO members can have legally binding security guarantees.\n\nLast December, we handed over to our Western partners a draft treaty between the Russian Federation and the United States of America on security guarantees, as well as a draft agreement on measures to ensure the security of the Russian Federation and NATO member states.\n\nThe United States and NATO responded with general statements. There were kernels of rationality in them as well, but they concerned matters of secondary importance and it all looked like an attempt to drag the issue out and to lead the discussion astray.\n\nWe responded to this accordingly and pointed out that we were ready to follow the path of negotiations, provided, however, that all issues are considered as a package that includes Russia’s core proposals which contain three key points. First, to prevent further NATO expansion. Second, to have the Alliance refrain from deploying assault weapon systems on Russian borders. And finally, rolling back the bloc's military capability and infrastructure in Europe to where they were in 1997, when the NATO-Russia Founding Act was signed.\n\nThese principled proposals of ours have been ignored. To reiterate, our Western partners have once again vocalised the all-too-familiar formulas that each state is entitled to freely choose ways to ensure its security or to join any military union or alliance. That is, nothing has changed in their stance, and we keep hearing the same old references to NATO’s notorious “open door” policy. Moreover, they are again trying to blackmail us and are threatening us with sanctions, which, by the way, they will introduce no matter what as Russia continues to strengthen its sovereignty and its Armed Forces. To be sure, they will never think twice before coming up with or just fabricating a pretext for yet another sanction attack regardless of the developments in Ukraine. Their one and only goal is to hold back the development of Russia. And they will keep doing so, just as they did before, even without any formal pretext just because we exist and will never compromise our sovereignty, national interests or values.\n\nI would like to be clear and straightforward: in the current circumstances, when our proposals for an equal dialogue on fundamental issues have actually remained unanswered by the United States and NATO, when the level of threats to our country has increased significantly, Russia has every right to respond in order to ensure its security. That is exactly what we will do.\n\nWith regard to the state of affairs in Donbass, we see that the ruling Kiev elites never stop publicly making clear their unwillingness to comply with the Minsk Package of Measures to settle the conflict and are not interested in a peaceful settlement. On the contrary, they are trying to orchestrate a blitzkrieg in Donbass as was the case in 2014 and 2015. We all know how these reckless schemes ended.\n\nNot a single day goes by without Donbass communities coming under shelling attacks. The recently formed large military force makes use of attack drones, heavy equipment, missiles, artillery and multiple rocket launchers. The killing of civilians, the blockade, the abuse of people, including children, women and the elderly, continues unabated. As we say, there is no end in sight to this.\n\nMeanwhile, the so-called civilised world, which our Western colleagues proclaimed themselves the only representatives of, prefers not to see this, as if this horror and genocide, which almost 4 million people are facing, do not exist. But they do exist and only because these people did not agree with the West-supported coup in Ukraine in 2014 and opposed the transition towards the Neanderthal and aggressive nationalism and neo-Nazism which have been elevated in Ukraine to the rank of national policy. They are fighting for their elementary right to live on their own land, to speak their own language, and to preserve their culture and traditions.\n\nHow long can this tragedy continue? How much longer can one put up with this? Russia has done everything to preserve Ukraine’s territorial integrity. All these years, it has persistently and patiently pushed for the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 2202 of February 17, 2015, which consolidated the Minsk Package of Measures of February 12, 2015, to settle the situation in Donbass.\n\nEverything was in vain. Presidents and Rada deputies come and go, but deep down the aggressive and nationalistic regime that seized power in Kiev remains unchanged. It is entirely a product of the 2014 coup, and those who then embarked on the path of violence, bloodshed and lawlessness did not recognise then and do not recognise now any solution to the Donbass issue other than a military one.\n\nIn this regard, I consider it necessary to take a long overdue decision and to immediately recognise the independence and sovereignty of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic.\n\nI would like to ask the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation to support this decision and then ratify the Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance with both republics. These two documents will be prepared and signed shortly.\n\nWe want those who seized and continue to hold power in Kiev to immediately stop hostilities. Otherwise, the responsibility for the possible continuation of the bloodshed will lie entirely on the conscience of Ukraine’s ruling regime.\n\nAs I announce the decisions taken today, I remain confident in the support of Russia’s citizens and the country’s patriotic forces.\n\nThank you."

Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre, sur les grandes orientations de la politique gouvernementale notamment en matière d'industrialisation, de santé, d'éducation, de sécurité et d'agriculture, à l'Assemblée nationale le 30 janvier 2024.\n\n    Institutions\n\nPrononcé le 30 janvier 2024\nIntervenant(s) : \n\n    Gabriel Attal - Premier ministre \n\nTexte intégral\n\nMadame la Présidente,\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nLe propre de toute société humaine, c'est de regarder en face l'avenir qui se dessine devant elle. Interroger son modèle, puiser en soi les ressources suffisantes pour avancer, corriger ce qui doit l'être, construire les bonnes solutions.\n\nUne société ne se perd jamais quand elle cherche à avancer.\n\nUne société ne se perd jamais quand elle doute. Elle se perd quand le doute l'emporte sur tout le reste. Quand le doute glace, quand il fige, quand il conduit à douter non-pas de l'avenir qui se dessine, mais à douter de soi-même, de ses forces et de ses capacités.\n\nJe suis né en 1989, l'année du bicentenaire de la Révolution.\nUne année, 89, où l'on a cru que la démocratie libérale et le progrès universel triompheraient par eux-mêmes.\n\nMa génération a vu l'inverse se produire. Parce que notre génération, partout dans le monde, voit son monde chamboulé plus fortement encore que toute autre avant elle. Elle est en proie au doute.\n\nDoute sur l'avenir de sa planète.\nDoute sur son identité.\nDoute, ici, en France, sur qui nous sommes, comme peuple et comme Nation.\nDoute sur notre modèle social, sur nos services publics, sur notre démocratie.\n\nNotre responsabilité, celle de chacune et chacun d'entre nous, c'est de puiser en nous la force d'identifier tous les ressorts pour les surpasser.\nSi nous sommes là, ici réunis, si nous nous engageons, par-delà nos divergences et nos désaccords, c'est que nous avons un point commun, partagé par des dizaines de millions de nos concitoyens : nous voyons davantage de raisons d'espérer que de douter.\n\nC'est parce que nous sommes prêts à affronter pour avancer. Affronter pour avancer.\n\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nEn m'exprimant face à vous, c'est en réalité à chaque citoyen de notre pays que je m'adresse.\nEt à travers vous, c'est à chacun de nos concitoyens que je veux le dire : nous ne sommes pas n'importe quel pays.\nLa France n'a jamais été, n'est pas, ne sera jamais une Nation qui subit : ni hier, ni aujourd'hui, ni demain.\n\nDans les pires moments de doute, de désarroi, de désunion, elle a montré sa solidité, son supplément d'âme qui fait d'elle une Nation à nulle autre pareille.\nEn cette année 2024, nous commémorerons les 80 ans du débarquement, moment de libération d'une France, de soutien à des Français qui pour la plupart n'avaient jamais cessé de croire en elle.\n\nEn cette année 2024, nous rouvrirons les portes de Notre-Dame de Paris, alors que l'image rétinienne des flammes reste si vive dans l'esprit des Français.\nEn cette année 2024, nous accueillerons le monde, un monde bouleversé, divisé, oui nous accueillerons le monde à l'occasion des jeux olympiques et paralympiques.\n\nLa France rime avec puissance.\nLa France, c'est un repère, un idéal.\nC'est un patrimoine, témoin d'une Histoire millénaire.\n\nC'est un héritage moral, celui de la patrie où sont nés les Droits de l'Homme. Celui d'un modèle social, protecteur et envié dans le monde entier.\n\nLa France, c'est le pays de la création – que nous soutenons et qui nous fait rayonner.\nC'est la patrie de la recherche – à laquelle nous donnons des moyens sans précédent.\nC'est la Nation de l'innovation – qui construit le monde de demain, de 2030.\n\nLa France, ce sont nos jeunes, qui osent et se lancent.\nLa France, ce sont nos familles, et toutes ces mères célibataires qui se battent, qui ne lâchent rien, jamais rien.\nCe sont nos soignants, nos professeurs, nos forces de l'ordre, tous nos agents publics, nos militaires qui s'engagent pour que quelque chose qui les dépasse.\nCe sont nos artisans qui font rayonner nos savoirs-faire.\nNos agriculteurs, nos pêcheurs, qui travaillent matin, midi et soir pour nous nourrir.\nCe sont nos élus locaux, et je suis l'un des leurs depuis 10 ans, qui s'engagent et se donnent corps et âme pour leurs territoires.\nCe sont nos associations, nos bénévoles.\nLa France, c'est 68 millions de Français de l'Hexagone, des Outre-mer et de l'étranger, qui n'ont pas fini de nous surprendre.\n\nDans un monde où tout s'accélère et se transforme, je refuse, avec eux, que notre identité puisse se diluer ou se dissoudre.\nLa France a son rang à tenir, sa voix à faire entendre, sa singularité à imposer.\nNous avons une fierté française à maintenir. Une fierté européenne à consolider.\n\nAffronter pour avancer.\n\nLes difficultés économiques, les bouleversements climatiques, démographiques, géopolitiques, ne nous figeront jamais, ne nous conduiront jamais à nous perdre.\nIls ne signifient pas la fin de tout, mais le passage d'un monde à un autre.\nUn passage difficile, douloureux, inquiétant à bien des égards.\nMais un passage que nous réussirons. J'en suis intimement convaincu.\nÀ ceux qui veulent y voir notre disparition, j'y vois notre renaissance, parce que nous avons une identité et des valeurs. À ceux qui veulent y voir un triangle des Bermudes, j'y vois notre Cap Horn, parce que nous savons où nous voulons aller. À ceux qui veulent y voir une perte de boussole, j'y vois une détermination, parce que j'ai confiance.\n\nConfiance, parce que je connais le chemin que nous avons parcouru depuis 2017, les tabous que nous avons levés, les obstacles que nous avons franchis.\nJ'ai confiance parce que je connais les Français, leur énergie, leur volonté, leur créativité.\n\nJ'ai confiance, parce que face aux épreuves, aux inquiétudes et aux crises, notre pays s'est toujours relevé.\n\nL'épidémie de Covid a mis à jour bon nombre des fractures de notre société. Elle a poussé notre modèle social dans ses retranchements. Mais notre pays a tenu, et nous avons protégé nos concitoyens mieux que beaucoup d'autres ne l'ont fait.\n\nLe dérèglement climatique nous frappe, plus dur, plus fort, plus souvent. L'exceptionnel devient la norme. Les catastrophes se multiplient. Mais notre pays agit avec force, et jamais dans son Histoire, les émissions de gaz à effet de serre n'ont baissé aussi rapidement que l'an dernier !\n\nLa guerre en Ukraine a ébranlé l'Europe. Elle a détruit le rêve d'une paix éternelle sur notre continent. Elle nous a rappelé durement, que la démocratie était fragile, et la liberté un idéal toujours à défendre. Mais notre pays, notre Europe, ont montré le visage de la détermination face à l'agresseur et sa solidarité pour le peuple ukrainien !\n\nL'attaque terroriste monstrueuse en Israël et la guerre au Proche-Orient ont ravivé des plaies et des maux, jusque dans notre société. Mais notre pays a su se dresser, répondre par le refus de la haine et par l'unité !\n\nLa crise énergétique, l'inflation, la menace terroriste : les crises se superposent, s'enchevêtrent et s'additionnent. Elles n'offrent aucune solution miraculeuse. Mais méthodiquement, avec les Français, nous y répondrons !\n\nBien sûr, face à ces crises, pour beaucoup de Français, l'avenir est davantage une crainte et qu'une promesse.\nEt encore trop de Français ont le sentiment de perdre le contrôle de leur propre vie.\n\nAvec le Président de la République, avec mon Gouvernement, je ne m'y résous pas. Je ne m'y résoudrai jamais.\n\nPour tous ces Français, nous allons continuer à affronter pour avancer.\nPas par des belles paroles, des grandes tirades ou de beaux discours.\nMais par des actes. Rapides et concrets. De nouveaux changements dans leur vie et sur le terrain.\n\nMadame la Présidente,\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nSous l'égide du Président de la République, l'identité même de cette majorité, de ce Gouvernement, c'est de reconquérir notre souveraineté française et européenne !\n\nNotre promesse aux Français est claire : oui, nous voulons reprendre notre destin en main !\nEn ouvrant une nouvelle page de cette conquête, nous pouvons nous appuyer sur un bilan concret, solide, tangible.\n\nEn 2017, ma génération n'avait connu que la désindustrialisation qui semblait inéluctable, le chômage de masse qui s'ancrait, l'Europe qui se désunissait, la transition écologique qui rimait avec nécessité plus qu'avec réalité.\n\nAu fond, en 2017, la souveraineté de la France et de l'Europe était pour beaucoup un impensé. Pour certains même, c'était un gros mot.\n\nNous avons assumé de parler de souveraineté, et plus important encore : nous avons assumé d'en faire la matrice de notre action. Et nous avons agi.\nNous avons engagé une action résolue pour la souveraineté économique avec, pour la première fois, le retour de l'industrie sur notre sol – n'en déplaise aux Cassandre, il y a désormais plus d'usines qui ouvrent que d'usines qui ferment en France, plus d'emplois industriels qui y sont créés que détruits, ça n'était pas arrivé depuis 30 ans. Notre taux de chômage est descendu jusqu'à un niveau jamais atteint depuis 25 ans, et pour la 5ème année consécutive, notre pays est le plus attractif d'Europe pour les investissements étrangers.\n\nNous avons engagé une action résolue pour lutter contre le réchauffement climatique et conquérir notre indépendance énergétique, avec une planification écologique inédite dans le monde, et une stratégie énergétique pour une énergie plus souveraine et plus durable.\n\nNous avons engagé une action résolue pour la souveraineté de nos frontières, avec une loi immigration et un pacte asile-immigration au niveau européen enfin réellement protecteurs pour notre pays.\n\nNous avons engagé une action résolue, et elle prendra du temps, pour que chaque Française et chaque Français puisse garder le contrôle de sa propre vie. Qu'ils ne soient jamais entravés, jamais assignés à résidence, jamais résignés.\n\nEt, évidemment, nous avons engagé une action résolue pour la souveraineté agricole de notre pays.\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés, je le dis ici dès le début de mon intervention : notre agriculture est notre force. Pas simplement parce qu'elle nous alimente au sens propre du terme. Mais parce qu'elle constitue l'un des fondements de notre identité, de nos traditions. Parce que nos agriculteurs incarnent des valeurs fondamentales et qui lorsqu'elles sont bridées, fragilisent l'ensemble de la société. Je pense à la valeur du travail, à l'effort, à la liberté d'entreprendre.\n\nNotre agriculture est notre force, et notre fierté aussi. Alors je le dis ici solennellement : il doit y avoir une exception agricole française.\n\nJe suis lucide, face à l'empilement des normes, face aux décisions qui tombent d'en haut et qui parfois tombent d'on ne sait où, elle doute, elle aussi, et attend des réponses et des solutions.\n\nNous serons au rendez-vous. Sans ambiguïté.\n\nMadame la Présidente,\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nDevant vous, je prends la parole, humble face à l'ampleur de la tâche à accomplir.\n\nJe veux m'adresser à tous les Français : ceux qui doutent et ceux qui espèrent. Ceux qui écoutent et ceux qui n'y croient plus.\nJe veux m'adresser à tous ces Français, souvent de la classe moyenne, toujours au rendez-vous de leurs responsabilités, qui ne se plaignent pas alors qu'ils ont si souvent le sentiment de subir. A ces Français qui ont le sentiment d'avoir tous les devoirs, quand d'autres ont tous les droits.\n\nÀ ces Français qui ont parfois le sentiment que leur propre pays s'éloigne, qu'ils n'y ont plus vraiment leur place, alors qu'ils en sont le cœur battant.\n\nÀ ces Français de l'entre deux, trop riches pour bénéficier des aides, mais pas assez pour ne pas compter, qui ont le sentiment que les décisions se prennent sans eux et qu'elles bénéficient toujours aux mêmes.\n\nÀ ces Français qui ont parfois l'impression de vivre dans une France archipel, dont les ponts seraient sur le point de se rompre. Mais ces Français qui espèrent au fond d'eux qu'on parviendra à les réunir.\n\nÀ ces Français qui ne demandent pas la lune, mais simplement à pouvoir vivre de leur travail, éduquer leurs enfants, se soigner, et vivre en sécurité.\nJe les entends. Je les comprends. Et comme la majorité y œuvre depuis 2017, je veux leur répondre.\n\nJe le veux avec d'autant plus de détermination, que je sais le risque, pour eux, de les laisser céder à des sirènes qui ne conduiraient qu'au chaos, à la division et à l'effondrement.\nCar je suis lucide, pendant que nous agissons : certains guettent, entretiennent les colères et espèrent en récolter les fruits.\n\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nLe défi est immense et j'ai bien conscience que nous ne pourrons pas le relever seuls, avec mes ministres, que je remercie pour leur engagement sans faille.\n\nJ'ai bien conscience, aussi, du message très clair exprimé par les Français en 2022.\nNous avons une majorité, que je salue et à qui je veux dire ma confiance et ma fidélité. Mais cette majorité est relative et les Français attendent que nous cessions les querelles de principes pour échanger et pour agir ensemble.\n\nDepuis 2022, depuis 18 mois, sur bien des textes, nous y sommes parvenus. Et aujourd'hui, je le dis à la majorité comme aux oppositions : nous avons la France en partage.\n\nNous avons, je le crois, un devoir commun de transcender les clivages, les désaccords et les divisions pour œuvrer au service des Français.\nÉvidemment, nous ne serons pas d'accord sur tout.\n\nÉvidemment, nous nous opposerons, dans cet hémicycle et ailleurs.\nMais je vous le dis : je ne renoncerai jamais à dialoguer. Ma porte sera toujours ouverte. Parce qu'à travers vous, Mesdames et Messieurs les députés de oppositions, ce sont les voix de millions de Français qui s'expriment.\nMême si je ne suis pas convaincu que ces millions de Français attendent qu'on cherche à couvrir son interlocuteur par des cris pendant qu'il intervient dans l'hémicycle de l'Assemblée nationale !\n\nC'est aussi cela, la méthode que je veux pour mon Gouvernement : respecter les Français, respecter les oppositions, respecter notre Parlement. Je m'y engage, et j'en serai le garant.\nMa méthode a toujours été la même.\nChaque Français porte une vérité sur notre pays. Nous devons l'écouter et y répondre.\nForces politiques, organisations syndicales, élus locaux, Français : depuis ma nomination, j'ai entamé des échanges, toujours avec franchise et lucidité.\nAlors, avec vous, je veux faire résonner les mots de nos concitoyens, répondre à leurs inquiétudes et porter leurs espoirs.\n\nAlors Mesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nMa priorité est claire : favoriser le travail pour que ceux qui en sont éloignés s'en rapprochent, en soutenant ceux qui n'ont que le fruit de leur travail pour vivre, et qui sont toujours au rendez-vous de leurs responsabilités.\n\nMon cap est clair : c'est celui de la souveraineté et de l'indépendance, à l'échelle individuelle, nationale et européenne.\n\nMa méthode est claire, elle reste la même : dire la vérité, même quand ça fait mal, même quand cela nous conduit à remettre en cause nos propres décisions. Dire la vérité, donc, et agir.\nAgir vraiment, agir maintenant !\n\n\nMadame la Présidente,\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nParler aux Français, c'est entendre quatre appels à l'action.\nPour le travail, pour qu'il paie mieux et toujours plus que l'inactivité – partout et pour tous.\n\nPour nos services publics, pour qu'ils soient accessibles et de qualité – partout et pour tous.\nPour l'autorité, le civisme et le respect des droits et devoirs – partout et pour tous.\nPour un environnement plus respirable – partout et pour tous.\n\nEt je veux l'affirmer : nous n'avons pas renoncé aux grandes conquêtes et à la création de droits nouveaux.\n\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nPour le travail,\nPour nos services publics et le rétablissement de l'autorité dans notre société,\nPour la transition écologique, nous partons aujourd'hui d'un bilan solide !\n\nDerrière le cap fixé par le Président de la République, nous avons multiplié les actions et les réformes.\nEt je veux ici rendre hommage à l'action déterminante d'Edouard PHILIPPE, de Jean CASTEX et d'Elisabeth BORNE, dont le sens de l'État et la détermination à faire sont des exemples.\nJe veux rendre hommage à la majorité, toujours mobilisée pour améliorer le quotidien des Français.\nJe veux saluer tous les parlementaires, qui ont accepté de sortir des logiques partisanes pour permettre l'adoption de nombreux textes.\n\nAujourd'hui, de premiers résultats sont là.\n\nDepuis 2017, nous avons montré que le chômage de masse n'était pas une fatalité.\nNous avons engagé des réformes fortes, qui avaient trop longtemps été repoussées.\nNous avons pris les ordonnances travail, dès le début du premier quinquennat.\nNous avons mené une réforme de l'assurance-chômage, une réforme de l'apprentissage, une réforme des retraites.\nNous avons lancé le contrat d'engagement jeune, baissé les impôts et les charges et engagé une réforme majeure du lycée professionnel.\n\nAujourd'hui, le chômage a baissé de plus de 2 points !\n2 millions d'emplois ont été créés !\nNotre industrie revient avec 100 000 emplois industriels créés et la réouverture de 300 usines !\n\nLe nombre d'apprentis a plus que triplé. Ils sont désormais plus de 850 000 en France et nous avons le cap du million en vue !\nDepuis 2017, nous avons agi massivement pour nos services publics.\n\nPour notre santé, avec les 19 milliards du Ségur de la santé, avec une revalorisation historique des soignants, avec l'augmentation du nombre de places dans les études de médecine, d'infirmier et d'aide-soignant !\nPour notre école, nous avons engagé des transformations majeures et agi pour l'égalité des chances. Je pense au dédoublement des classes ou encore à l'augmentation du salaire des enseignants, la plus forte depuis 30 ans.\nPour notre sécurité, nous avons investi comme jamais par le passé : 10 000 postes de policiers et gendarmes ont été créés lors du premier quinquennat. 8500 de plus le seront lors de celui-ci et nous avons lancé la création de 238 nouvelles brigades de gendarmerie. La sécurité, ça doit être pour tous, y compris dans la ruralité et dans les petites villes.\n\nDepuis 2017, pour la planète, nous avons préféré aux grands mots les vrais actes ! Nous agissons ! Et nous agissons plus qu'aucune majorité avant nous !\n\nAvant 2017, les émissions de gaz à effet de serre diminuaient de 1% en moyenne par an. Dans le premier quinquennat, elles ont baissé de 2% en moyenne par an. L'an dernier, sur les 9 premiers mois de l'année, elles ont baissé de près de 5%. C'est le crédit de notre action sur la transition écologique !\nConformément à l'engagement du Président de la République, nous avons désormais une stratégie complète, secteur par secteur, territoire par territoire : la planification écologique.\nNous nous donnons les moyens de réussir et nous investissons cette année 40 milliards d'euros pour la transition écologique !\n\nMadame la Présidente,\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nNous avons beaucoup fait, mais il reste encore du chemin.\n\nAlors avec mon Gouvernement, je suis prêt. Je suis déterminé.\n\nNous devons répondre aux inquiétudes de la classe moyenne et faire en sorte que ceux qui vont travailler puissent vivre de leur travail, et gagnent toujours plus que ceux qui ne travaillent pas.\n\nNous devons répondre aux défis des emplois non-pourvus, car il est incompréhensible que le chômage reste autour de 7%, alors qu'il y a tant d'entreprises et de filières qui cherchent à recruter partout sur le territoire national.\n\nNous avons en France un paradoxe. Nous avons un salaire minimum, un SMIC, nettement supérieur à celui de nos voisins, et nous en sommes fiers. Mais nous avons une part de nos travailleurs proches du SMIC beaucoup plus importante que nos voisins. C'est un problème.\n\nD'abord, nous agirons résolument pour que les branches professionnelles qui continuent à rémunérer en dessous du SMIC remontent ces rémunérations. C'était le cas d'une soixantaine d'entre elles l'été dernier. Grâce à la mobilisation engagée alors, nous étions descendus à une trentaine à la fin de l'année 2023. La revalorisation du SMIC au 1er janvier en a fait redescendre une partie en dessous. Je souhaite poursuivre et amplifier la mobilisation pour des résultats rapides, et je n'exclus aucune mesure pour y parvenir.\n\nEnsuite, nous devons faire évoluer un système qui nous a conduits, depuis des décennies, à concentrer nos aides, nos exonérations, au niveau du SMIC.\nAujourd'hui, pour augmenter de 100€ le revenu d'un employé au SMIC, l'employeur doit débourser 238 euros de plus.\nQuant au salarié, il perdra 39€ de prime d'activité, il voit sa CSG ses cotisations sociales augmenter de 26€ et il entre dans l'impôt sur le revenu.\nEn bref, autant le dire, notre système, fruit de réformes successives pétries de bonnes intentions ces dernières décennies, a placé notre monde économique dans une situation où il n'y a quasiment plus aucun intérêt pour quiconque à augmenter un salarié au SMIC.\n\nOn ne peut accepter une France où beaucoup sont condamnés à rester proches du SMIC toute leur carrière. La progression salariale doit, toujours, permettre de récompenser l'effort et le mérite.\nAlors oui, j'assume de le dire, il faut désmicardiser la France. Dès le prochain projet de loi de finance, en nous appuyant sur les propositions des parlementaires, des partenaires sociaux et sur un certain nombre de travaux d'experts qui sont actuellement conduits, nous commencerons à réformer ce système.\n\nDans le même temps, nous devons continuer à baisser les charges qui pèsent sur la classe moyenne. Après la suppression de la taxe d'habitation, de la redevance télé, après la baisse de 5 milliards d'euros des premières tranches de l'impôt sur le revenu, nous tiendrons l'engagement du Président de la\nRépublique d'une nouvelle baisse d'impôts de 2 milliards d'euros. Cette baisse d'impôt sera financée et la solidarité nationale devra s'exercer pour nos classes moyennes.\n\nValoriser le travail, ce n'est pas seulement pour les salariés.\n\nNous agirons aussi pour nos fonctionnaires, qui permettent à l'État d'avancer et s'engagent au service de l'intérêt général, en intégrant leur mérite et leurs efforts à leur rémunération. Un projet de loi sera déposé dès le second semestre de cette année.\n\nNous agirons pour nos indépendants, tous nos commerçants, nos artisans, nos agriculteurs qui sont indépendants. En 2026, nous aurons réformé l'assiette sociale des indépendants. Cela veut dire plus de droits, notamment plus de droits à la retraite, sans payer davantage de cotisations. C'est l'engagement de cette majorité.\n\nDeuxième objectif : pour réussir, je veux déverrouiller l'accès au travail, déverrouiller notre société.\n\nJe veux permettre à tous ceux qui le peuvent de travailler, avec en tête les droits et les devoirs de chacun.\n\nLe droit d'être mieux accompagné, grâce à la réforme de France Travail. Mais aussi le devoir de chercher un emploi.\n\nDans 18 départements, nous avons lancé une expérimentation qui conditionne le RSA à 15 heures d'activité pour l'insertion. Je vous annonce que nous généraliserons ce dispositif à tous les départements de France, d'ici le 1er janvier 2025.\n\nDe plus, nous devons aller plus loin dans la réforme de l'assurance chômage.\nUne négociation a été lancée en faveur de l'emploi des seniors, de la prévention de l'usure professionnelle, des parcours et des reconversions, et nous souhaitons qu'elles aboutissent à un résultat ambitieux.\nMais la situation économique évolue. Parce que nous gardons notre objectif de plein-emploi et que nous devons inciter toujours plus à la reprise du travail, je serai extrêmement attentif à l'évolution de la trajectoire financière de l'assurance-chômage.\nSi cette dernière dévie, je n'hésiterai pas, comme la loi le permet, à demander aux partenaires sociaux de remettre l'ouvrage sur le métier, sur la base d'une nouvelle lettre de cadrage autour d'une ambition très claire : inciter toujours plus à la reprise du travail. Sans tabou.\n\nNous combattrons également toutes les trappes à inactivité. D'un côté en rendant les droits effectifs. Nous avons été capables de faire le prélèvement à la source. Nous serons capables de mener à bien la solidarité à la source, pour éviter les démarches inutiles et garantir la pleine justice sociale : que chacun touche l'intégralité de ce à quoi il a droit.\n\nCombattre les trappes à inactivité, c'est aussi assumer de réinterroger notre modèle. Je pense notamment à l'allocation de solidarité spécifique, qui prolonge l'indemnisation du chômage et qui permet, sans travailler, de valider des trimestres de retraite. Nous avons une conviction et une cohérence forte. Nous considérons que la retraite doit toujours rester le fruit du travail et donc nous proposerons la bascule de l'allocation de solidarité spécifique au RSA et la suppression de cette allocation.\nChercher un modèle social plus efficace et moins coûteux, ce n'est pas un gros mot, c'est un impératif.\n\nDéverrouiller le travail, c'est aussi l'adapter aux nouvelles aspirations de nos concitoyens.\n\nC'est un fait : le rapport au travail a changé. Je mesure, dans ma génération comme dans les autres, les changements de mentalité, les attentes nouvelles, sur les horaires, sur la disponibilité, sur l'équilibre entre vie professionnelle et vie familiale. Ces aspirations ne doivent pas être niées. Elles ne doivent pas être caricaturées non plus. Au risque de décevoir certains ici, personne ne demande de « droit à la paresse ».\n\nNon, ces aspirations, elles doivent être regardées pour ce qu'elles sont : notre rapport au travail, c'est notre rapport au temps. À l'équilibre personnel.\nOn ne peut pas appliquer les mêmes calques, générations après générations.\nLes attentes changent, les technologies évoluent et font apparaître de nouvelles fractures – notamment entre ceux qui peuvent télétravailler et ceux qui ne le peuvent pas-, alors les conditions de travail doivent évoluer aussi. Et l'État doit donner l'exemple.\nComme ministre des Comptes publics, j'avais décidé, contre vents et marées, d'expérimenter dans mon administration non pas la semaine de 4 jours, mais la semaine en 4 jours, sans réduction du temps de travail.\nÀ certains endroits, il y a eu peu de candidats, à d'autres, ils sont nombreux à avoir choisi d'arriver plus tôt le matin et de partir plus tard le soir pour travailler un jour de moins. Comme Premier ministre, je demande à l'ensemble de mes ministres d'expérimenter cette solution dans leurs administrations centrales et déconcentrées.\n\nOui, l'État doit donner l'exemple s'agissant de l'organisation du travail, notamment pour toutes ces personnes qui travaillent dur et se sentent invisibles. Je pense, notamment, aux personnes du ménage, parfois forcées à faire des heures de transports en commun au milieu de la nuit, tout ça pour éviter qu'elles ne travaillent en même temps que les salariés. Là aussi, je veux que l'État montre l'exemple et que, désormais, dans l'État, les personnels d'entretien de l'administration qui le souhaitent puissent travaillent aux mêmes horaires que tout le monde : aux horaires de bureau.\n\nOui, nous devons mieux prendre en compte notre rapport au temps, et nous continuerons à avancer dans le chantier du compte épargne-temps universel, véritable « sac à dos social » qui doit permettre à ceux qui le souhaitent de travailler beaucoup plus à certains moments de leur vie où ils le peuvent, notamment quand ils sont jeunes et n'ont pas encore de responsabilité familiale, pour pouvoir, ensuite, travailler moins à d'autres moments de leur vie, pour développer un projet, s'occuper de leur famille ou d'un proche qui en a besoin.\n\nDéverrouiller notre économie, c'est aussi conquérir de nouvelles libertés, refuser le principe de rente, être capable, de continuer à transformer et libérer. Un projet de loi en ce sens sera examiné au printemps.\nIl permettra notamment de déverrouiller certaines professions comme les syndics ou encore les ventes en ligne de médicaments par les pharmacies.\n\nMesdames et messieurs les députés, beaucoup d'entre vous me l'ont dit, s'il est un secteur qu'il faut déverrouiller, c'est bien le logement.\n\nLe problème du logement est clair : il tient à la fois à l'offre et à la demande. Or pouvoir se loger, acquérir son logement, c'est pour tant de Français le projet d'une vie, l'assurance d'une retraite sereine.\nEn lien avec les élus locaux, nous répondrons à cette crise du logement, en créant un choc d'offres, avec plusieurs solutions immédiates :\n\n    Nous allons simplifier massivement les normes : revoir les DPE, simplifier l'accès à MaPrimeRénov, faciliter la densification, lever les contraintes sur le zonage, accélérer les procédures.\n    Ensuite, nous désignerons dans deux semaines, 20 territoires engagés pour le logement, où nous accélèrerons toutes les procédures, comme nous avons su le faire pour l'organisation des Jeux Olympiques et paralympiques, avec comme objectif d'y créer 30 000 nouveaux logements d'ici 3 ans.\n    Nous n'hésiterons à procéder à des réquisitions pour des bâtiments vides, notamment des bâtiments de bureaux. Nous l'avons déjà fait et nous continuerons à le faire.\n    Nous continuerons à soutenir le monde du logement social. Nous avons agi pour lui en maintenant le taux du livret A, avec 1,2 milliard d'euros pour leur rénovation énergétique, avec des plans de rachat massif. Nous voulons également répondre aux causes structurelles de la crise : le coût élevé du foncier, grâce un nouveau prêt de très long terme : 2 milliards d'euros, distribués par la Banque des Territoires. Et nous allons aussi le faire évoluer.\n    Le faire évoluer pour inciter les élus à développer de nouveaux programmes. Aussi, je vous annonce que nous allons donner aux maires la main pour la première attribution dans les nouveaux logements sociaux construits sur leur commune. C'était une mesure très attendue par les élus locaux.\n    Nous allons aussi engager un chantier, une réflexion pour faire évoluer le logement social, pour qu'il réponde davantage aux classes moyennes. Vous le savez, d'ici 2025, toutes les communes soumises à la loi SRU doivent posséder au moins un quart de logements sociaux sur leur territoire. Nous proposerons d'ajouter pour une part les logements intermédiaires, accessibles à la classe moyenne, dans ce calcul des 25%.\n\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nDésmicardiser pour promouvoir le travail, dévérouiller pour libérer l'initiative et la croissance, je veux aussi débureaucratiser la France.\n\nJe veux alléger le fardeau des règles et des normes qui pèse sur ceux qui créent nos TPE et nos PME, sur tous ces Français qui travaillent sans compter et créent de l'activité et de l'emploi.\nIl a été évalué que chaque année, ce sont 60 milliards d'euros que nous perdons à cause des démarches et des complexités de notre quotidien.\nAussi, nous engagerons après l'été une nouvelle étape de la réforme du droit du travail. Avec un objectif clair : libérer les énergies de nos TPE et PME, simplifier considérablement leur quotidien et leur permettre de négocier certaines règles directement, entreprise par entreprise.\n\nMais cet élan de simplification ne doit pas se limiter au travail.\n\nPartout dans notre pays, les Français me racontent combien les normes les oppressent, les brident, les empêchent de faire et d'avancer.\nJe pense à nos agriculteurs. Je pense à tous les petits patrons. Je pense à nos élus locaux, qui croulent sous les règles et les procédures administratives.\nÀ date, le nombre de mots pour dire des normes, sur Légifrance, s'élève à 44,1 millions de mots. C'est pratiquement deux fois plus qu'il y a 20 ans.\nÀ tous les échelons, je veux débureaucratiser la France.\n\nNous évaluerons les normes qui peuvent être supprimées ou simplifiées, avec les Français, avec les professionnels, avec les élus. Nous regarderons les démarches qui peuvent être améliorées. Tous les sujets sont sur la table.\nMon seul objectif, c'est de libérer les Français ! C'est de les laisser vivre et respirer !\n\nSupprimer des normes, c'est possible : vendredi dernier, j'ai annoncé la suppression de 10 normes nationales pour nos agriculteurs – et beaucoup d'autres suivront ! Au niveau local, en Haute-Garonne, en quelques réunions sur une semaine, le préfet et les agriculteurs se sont accordés sur l'abrogation de 4 arrêtés préfectoraux. Cette logique est étendue dès cette semaine à l'ensemble des départements français.\n\nSimplifier des démarches, c'est possible, et je vous annonce que dès cette année, chacun pourra enfin porter plainte en ligne, partout sur le territoire.\n\nSimplifier pour éviter la gabegie, c'est possible, et je vous annonce une règle générale simple : tous les organes, organismes, comités ou autres, qui ne se sont pas réunis ces 12 derniers mois, seront supprimés automatiquement.\n\nEnfin, des pans entiers de notre économie demandent des simplifications encore drastiques, notamment pour accélérer le retour de notre industrie.\nPourquoi ? Parce que trop de délais, c'est moins de projets. Et donc moins d'emplois et moins de croissance.\nQuand un investisseur veut implanter un projet en Europe, quelque chose lui saute aux yeux : en France, il faut 17 mois en moyenne pour implanter un projet industriel, en Allemagne, c'est deux fois moins. Ça ne peut pas continuer !\nAvec le projet de loi industrie verte, nous avons marqué une première étape. Je vous annonce que nous déposerons un deuxième projet de loi industrie verte. Il proposera notamment de concentrer les travaux de la CNDP, uniquement sur les projets d'envergure nationale. C'est 6 mois de gagnés dans les procédures sur les autres projets.\n\nLa bureaucratie qui recule, c'est la liberté qui avance !\nJe veux libérer les Français des contraintes qui les freinent et sont autant de boulets pour notre économie.\n\nMadame la Présidente,\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nDéverrouiller, désmicardiser, débureaucratiser. Oui, mais dans un seul objectif : réarmer notre pays.\n\nJe veux le dire d'emblée, le préalable au réarmement de la France, c'est la responsabilité budgétaire.\nNous devons faire preuve d'une responsabilité exemplaire dans nos finances publiques.\nIl en va de notre souveraineté.\nIl en va de la survie de notre modèle social.\nIl en va de la protection des plus fragiles et des classes moyennes, qui seraient les premières victimes des coupes massives et des hausses d'impôts drastiques, auxquels nous serions contraints si nous ne tenons pas notre trajectoire de réduction de nos déficits et de notre dette.\nEt je le dis : pour nous, le meilleur moyen de réduire nos déficits, c'est le travail et la croissance.\nPour certains, la croissance est un gros mot et ils n'ont que le mot « taxer » à la bouche. Tout y est passé dans les propositions parlementaires ces deux dernières années ! J'étais aux premières loges en tant que ministre des Comptes publics : les heures supplémentaires des ouvriers, le patrimoine des retraités, et même les successions des petits agriculteurs ! A ceux-là je leur réaffirme : quand on taxe tout, très vite, il n'y a plus rien à taxer, et on ne taxe plus rien du tout !\n\nJe vous confirme que nous tiendrons le même cap : repasser sous les 3% de déficit public d'ici 2027, grâce à plus de croissance, plus d'activité et à la maîtrise de nos dépenses ; pas grâce à trop d'impôts. Grâce à des économies de structure, aussi.\n\nNous mettrons toutes nos forces dans la bataille. Nous allons poursuivre et renforcer les revues de dépenses, auxquelles tous les ministères et tous les secteurs de l'action publique seront associés. Les premières propositions d'économies pour le prochain PLF issues de ce travail seront annoncées dès le mois de mars, et je souhaite qu'elles donnent lieu, très vite, à des échanges avec la représentation nationale.\n\nMadame la Présidente,\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nCe réarmement que nous construisons avec le Président de la République, il a un objectif prioritaire : assurer notre souveraineté.\n\nAlors oui, nous continuerons à renforcer notre souveraineté nationale, où nos frontières sont respectées. La lutte contre l'immigration illégale doit continuer à s'intensifier. Il faut assumer d'accueillir moins pour accueillir mieux.\nNous continuerons à déployer la Border force, lancée dans les Alpes-Maritimes, qui a déjà permis plusieurs dizaines de milliers d'interpellations à la frontière italienne.\nJe tiendrai l'engagement de ma prédécesseure de réformer l'aide médicale d'État. Nous le ferons avant l'été par voie réglementaire, avec une base qui est connue : le rapport Evin – Stefanini.\n\nDéfendre notre souveraineté nationale, c'est aussi donner les moyens nécessaires à nos Armées pour protéger notre territoire et nos valeurs.\nNos militaires se battent, au péril de leur vie, pour défendre notre pays et notre République. Et dans le cadre de la loi de programmation militaire, nous tiendrons nos engagements vis-à-vis d'eux. En deux quinquennats, nous aurons doublé le budget du ministère des Armées.\nAvec vous toutes et tous, je veux rendre hommage aux femmes et aux hommes de nos Armées. Rendre hommage à ceux qui sont tombés pour nous défendre. Leur sacrifice nous oblige. Notre reconnaissance est infinie.\n\nNotre souveraineté, c'est aussi notre capacité à répondre aux besoins de nos concitoyens. Et donc, sur ces fondements, nous allons réarmer nos services publics. Ils ont toujours été une fierté. Ils doivent le rester et pour certains d'entre eux le redevenir !\nNous allons continuer à réarmer notre système de santé !\n\nEt, avec vous, je veux rendre hommage à tous les soignants de France ! Chacun à leur poste, chacun dans leur spécialité, ils sont les visages de l'engagement et de l'accompagnement ! De l'attention et de l'humanité !\n\nAujourd'hui, quel est le problème ? Malgré le travail de nos soignants, le temps médical manque. Nos compatriotes ne trouvent pas de médecins et les délais aux urgences se rallongent. Cela se traduit par la désertification de notre pays, et par la saturation de nos hôpitaux, en particulier des urgences.\n\nL'objectif est clair : plus de temps médical.\nPremier pilier : agir pour qu'il y ait plus de médecins devant les Français.\nLes effets de la suppression du numerus clausus ne se feront pas sentir immédiatement, alors nous allons mettre en œuvre des solutions fortes, tout de suite.\nC'est pourquoi, comme l'a annoncé le Président de la République, nous procèderons à la régularisation des médecins étrangers sur notre territoire.\nC'est pourquoi aussi, je vous l'annonce, je nommerai un émissaire, chargé d'aller chercher à l'étranger des médecins qui voudraient venir exercer en France. Nous devons trouver les moyens de faire revenir nos jeunes français, qui sont partis étudier à l'étranger.\nNous devons aussi, et c'est ce qu'a proposé le député NEUDER, mieux reconnaitre l'expertise et de la volonté de soignants, qui ont fait beaucoup d'études et ont une vraie expérience. Une infirmière anesthésiste, qui a un bac+5, plusieurs années de carrière et d'expérience, elle doit pouvoir si elle le souhaite entrer directement au moins en 3ème année de médecine.\n\nDeuxième pilier : agir pour qu'il n'y ait aucun territoire oublié.\nNous avons depuis 2017 déployé le service d'accès aux soins – le SAS. Il permet un progrès notable dans l'accès aux soins non programmés. Je l'ai vu encore récemment à Dijon.\nDès cet été, chaque département devra être doté d'un service d'accès aux soins, avec des professionnels organisés pour assurer la permanence des soins.\nDans les départements où il n'y aurait toujours pas de service d'accès aux soins et de réponse satisfaisante, je suis prêt à aller plus loin, en restaurant des obligations de garde pour les médecins libéraux, en soirée ou le week-end, dans leurs cabinets, à l'hôpital ou en maisons de santé.\nTroisième pilier : libérer les médecins pour qu'ils se concentrent sur le soin.\n\nNous poursuivrons les chantiers que nous avons engagés, notamment pour l'attractivité de tous les métiers du soin.\n\nNous allons accélérer le passage de 6 000 à 10 000 assistants médicaux, qui permettront aux médecins de pouvoir se consacrer davantage aux patients et moins aux formalités administratives. Cela représentera 2,5 millions de consultations libérées tous les ans pour les patients !\n\nEnsuite, nous allons poursuivre notre action en faveur de l'hôpital. Les moyens du Ségur de la santé ne sont pas encore arrivés partout. Ces lourdeurs et ces lenteurs sont insupportables. Cela changera rapidement !\n\nEnfin, il y a encore aujourd'hui trop de rendez-vous médicaux qui ne sont pas honorés.\nPour les médecins, il est insupportable d'avoir chaque jour, des patients qui ont un rendez-vous et ne se présentent pas.\nPour les Français, il est insupportable de savoir que des millions d'heures sont perdues alors qu'ils attendent parfois des mois pour un rendez-vous.\nJe souhaite un principe simple, qui se traduise par des mesures claires dès cette année : quand on a un rendez-vous chez le médecin et qu'on ne vient pas sans prévenir, on paye.\n\nProtéger nos concitoyens, c'est aussi les accompagner à tous les âges de la vie et toutes les étapes de la vie.\nNous continuerons à agir pour l'enfance, notamment l'enfance en danger.\nNous continuerons à bâtir une société où chacun peut vieillir dignement et comme il l'entend, en facilitant le maintien à domicile de ceux qui le souhaitent et en améliorant le quotidien en EHPAD. Le défi humain et financier est immense. Nous avancerons ensemble.\n\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\nParler de santé, c'est trop souvent oublier la santé mentale.\nLe mal-être, les dépressions, les pensées suicidaires ont beaucoup progressé chez nos jeunes. Je veux faire de la santé mentale de notre jeunesse une grande cause de notre action gouvernementale. Avec, là aussi, des mesures claires et immédiates.\n\nD'abord, réformer le dispositif MonSoutienPsy. Il faut être lucide : ce dispositif partait d'une bonne intention, mais il n'a pas donné les résultats escomptés. Il faut avoir le courage de le reconnaître, même si c'est nous qui l'avons mis en place. Je vous annonce donc que nous allons le rénover de fond en comble.\n\nNous allons augmenter le tarif de la consultation remboursée pour limiter au maximum le reste à charge pour les jeunes patients et leurs familles.\nPour lever tous les verrous, nous permettrons aussi aux jeunes d'avoir accès directement à un psychologue pris en charge, sans nécessairement passer par un médecin.\n\nDe plus, nous devons mailler notre territoire de maisons départementales des adolescents. Il y en a 50 aujourd'hui, je souhaite qu'il y en ait une par département.\n\nPour la santé et notamment la santé psychologique, les infirmières scolaires sont des relais essentiels auprès des élèves. Elles accomplissent un travail remarquable. Elles accompagnent les jeunes avec disponibilité, écoute et soin. Nous devons recruter davantage d'infirmières scolaires et mieux reconnaître leur engagement.\n\nAussi, je vous annonce que grâce à un budget supplémentaire issu d'un amendement porté par les groupes de la majorité dans le dernier PLF, j'ai décidé de leur verser en mai prochain une prime exceptionnelle de 800€ et de revaloriser leur salaire de 200 euros nets par mois en moyenne à compter de cette date.\nJe demande également au Gouvernement de travailler à des revalorisations pour les autres personnes sociaux et sanitaire en milieu scolaire.\n\nMadame la Présidente,\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nRenforcer nos services publics, c'est aussi agir pour notre école.\n\nJe veux ici rendre hommage à nos professeurs.\nIls s'investissent tous les jours au service de notre école, de nos élèves, et donc de notre pays.\nJ'ai souvent dit ma fierté d'être leur ministre, et aujourd'hui, comme Premier ministre, je n'oublie rien de ce que nous leur devons. Je serai toujours à leurs côtés.\n\nJe l'ai dit sur le perron de l'hôtel de Matignon, dès mes premières minutes comme Premier ministre : l'école est la mère des batailles.\n\nSur l'école, là aussi il faut partir de la réalité des faits. Pas besoin des études internationales pour cela, il suffit d'écouter les Français !\n\nQue nous disent les parents, les grands-parents d'élèves ? Que ces dernières décennies, le niveau a baissé. Que si le nombre d'heures d'absence remplacées a triplé ces derniers mois, le compte n'y est toujours pas !\n\nQue nous disent les professeurs ? Qu'ils croient en leur métier, mais qu'il est de plus en plus difficile à exercer ! Qu'ils ont parfois peur d'enseigner des pans entiers de notre Histoire ou de notre littérature !\n\nQue nous disent les jeunes qui envisagent de devenir enseignants ? Quel la formation initiale telle qu'elle est organisée ne correspond pas à leurs attentes et freine leur vocation.\n\nNous allons continuer à leur répondre !\n\nPour élever le niveau des élèves, j'ai lancé le « choc des savoirs », il doit maintenant se déployer.\nLe choc des savoirs, c'est assumer que tout le monde ne progresse pas au même rythme, que tout le monde n'a pas les mêmes facilités ou les mêmes difficultés.\nLa décision du redoublement sera désormais à la main de l'équipe pédagogique, et les groupes de niveaux commenceront à se mettre en place, dès cette année, dans nos collèges.\nUne école du passage automatique, où l'on glisse de classe en classe sans vérifier si on a le niveau pour passer dans la classe supérieure, c'est une école où tout le monde stagne et le niveau baisse. Nous assumons de porter une école des savoirs et de l'excellence, où chacun apprend à son rythme.\n\nAméliorer les savoirs, c'est aussi agir sur la question des remplacements. Nous évaluerons le Pacte enseignant et si de nouvelles mesures s'imposent, nous les prendrons.\n\nVeiller au niveau des élèves, c'est réagir face aux nouveaux défis qui le menace. Les écrans sont une catastrophe éducative et sanitaire en puissance. Nous avons d'ores et déjà interdit le portable au collège. Et comme l'a annoncé le Président de la République, nous travaillerons à mieux réguler l'usage des écrans dans et en dehors de l'École pour nos enfants.\n\nJ'ajoute qu'une école des savoirs, c'est aussi une école qui permet de se projeter dans l'avenir. Désormais, tous les élèves de seconde devront faire un stage de deux semaines. Nous continuerons à rapprocher l'école et les métiers, des administrations, des associations.\n\nUne école qui fonctionne, c'est une école où les professeurs sont mieux formés. Nous réformerons la formation des enseignants, pour construire les écoles normales du XXIe siècle. Cette réforme sera présentée d'ici au mois de mars.\n\nUne école qui marche, c'est aussi une école où les élèves sont heureux.\nTrop longtemps, le bien-être des élèves est resté un impensé.\nLe résultat, nous le connaissons : ce sont notamment les drames du harcèlement. Notre stratégie contre le harcèlement, qui a permis de briser des tabous majeurs, est très concrète : désormais, c'est l'élève harceleur qui doit quitter l'école, plus l'élève victime qui subissait une double-peine. Je suis fier que nous ayons décidé de ce changement.\n\nLe bien-être à l'école, c'est aussi donner toute leur place aux élèves en situation de handicap. Bâtir une société inclusive est au cœur des priorités de mon Gouvernement.\nCela vaut dans tous les domaines, j'y serai très attentif.\nNous accompagnerons nos concitoyens en situation de handicap en toutes circonstances. Nous leur simplifierons la vie. Nous prendrons intégralement en charge le remboursement des fauteuils roulants de ceux qui en ont besoin !\nNous agirons partout – et particulièrement à l'école.\nDepuis des années, l'État et les collectivités se renvoient la balle sur la prise en charge des AESH sur la pause du midi. Résultat, dans beaucoup d'endroits, personne ne le finance. Et la conséquence, c'est une double défaite : des élèves pas suffisamment bien accompagnés au moment du repas, et des AESH qui ne peuvent faire un temps complet pour améliorer leur rémunération.\nIl faut sortir de cette situation et je prends une décision claire : l'État prend ses responsabilités et financera désormais l'accompagnement des enfants en situation de handicap sur leur pause déjeuner. C'est un enjeu de solidarité, de dignité, de reconnaissance.\n\nRéarmer notre école, c'est réaffirmer nos valeurs.\nCar je crois que la transmission du savoir est impossible sans respect de l'autorité. Sans respect de nos valeurs républicaines – au premier rang desquelles, la laïcité.\nOn ne négocie pas avec la République. On l'accepte et on la respecte, en entier, sans mais, sans la moindre exception !\nC'est pourquoi nous soutenons l'expérimentation de l'uniforme à l'école, symbole d'égalité républicaine. Et comme l'a annoncé le Président de la République, si cette expérimentation est concluante, nous généraliserons l'uniforme en France à la rentrée 2026.\n\nJe veux le dire également : je ne peux pas me résoudre à ce que certains professeurs craignent d'aborder certains chapitres du programme.\nÀ la moindre entorse à notre pacte républicain, il y doit y avoir des décisions fortes et des sanctions fermes. Cela doit nous conduire à revoir l'échelle des sanctions dans nos établissements scolaires pour ne rien laisser passer.\n\nL'école sera le fer de lance du réarmement civique demandé par le Président de la République. Comme il s'y est engagé, le nombre d'heures d'instruction civique sera doublé au collège.\n\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nRéussir le réarmement civique, c'est au cœur des priorités de mon Gouvernement.\n\nNous devons faire respecter l'autorité partout : dans les classes, dans les familles, dans les rues.\n\nCe respect s'apprend à l'école, je le disais.\n\nCe respect de l'autorité passe aussi par les familles.\n\nLes violences de juillet dernier ont profondément marqué notre pays. Parmi les émeutiers, des jeunes, très jeunes parfois, qui semblaient avoir déjà coupé les ponts avec notre société.\nQui ne respectent plus leurs parents ou pour qui la violence semble un moyen comme un autre de tromper l'ennui.\nJe ne me résoudrai jamais à ce qu'on préfère attendre avant de donner une lourde peine, alors que bien souvent, c'est très tôt qu'il aurait fallu agir.\n\nNous devons disposer de sanctions adaptées pour les mineurs de moins de 16 ans. Pour eux, on ne peut pas aujourd'hui prononcer de peine de travaux d'intérêt général. Je vous annonce que nous créerons des travaux d'intérêt éducatif, qui seront leurs équivalents et seront données plus facilement que les peines d'intérêt général.\nCela fera partie d'une revue de l'échelle des sanctions dans nos établissements scolaires. Dès le plus jeune âge, il faut en revenir à un principe simple : « tu casses, tu répares, tu salis, tu nettoies, tu défies l'autorité, tu apprends à la respecter ».\n\nNous responsabiliserons aussi davantage les parents. Dans le cadre du projet de loi sur la justice des mineurs, nous soutiendrons la mise en place de travaux d'intérêt général pour les parents de jeunes délinquants, qui se sont totalement et volontairement soustraits à leurs obligations et responsabilités parentales.\n\nMais je le dis : il est hors de question d'accabler certaines familles. Quand on est une mère seule, de plusieurs enfants dans un quartier, on peut être totalement dépassée par les évènements, et on n'est pas toujours responsable de la dérive de ses enfants. Pour elles, au contraire, cette dérive est un échec et une douleur terrible. Nous devons les aider.\n\nJe ne me résous pas à ce que nous ayons une situation, où nous avons des familles dépassées par les événements, avec des enfants qui ne respectent pas nos règles et qui sont violents d'un côté et 50 000 places d'internat disponibles, de l'autre.\nAussi, désormais, quand un jeune sera sur la mauvaise pente, plutôt que de le laisser plonger dans la délinquance, nous proposerons aux parents de le placer en internat, en y facilitant l'accès, y compris financier. Nous allons le couper de ses mauvaises fréquentations. Nous allons lui offrir un cadre, un enseignement et une chance !\n\nLe réarmement civique, c'est bien entendu le respect de la loi.\n\nNos concitoyens attendent de nous que nous agissions encore et toujours contre les violences, les trafics, les cambriolages.\nContre l'insécurité du quotidien et la délinquance.\nIls demandent de l'ordre dans nos rues.\n\nTout n'est pas une question de moyens. Il faut les mettre au service d'une stratégie plus offensive encore.\n\nComme l'a dit le Président de la République, nous allons doubler la présence policière dans les rues d'ici 2030.\n\nNous allons mener des actions coordonnées de tous les services de l'État, forces de l'ordre, éducation, services sociaux, dans certains quartiers. C'est le sens des Forces d'Actions Républicaines. Nous les déploierons fin février dans trois premiers territoires : à Maubeuge, Valence et Besançon.\nContre l'insécurité, nous nous sommes fixé deux priorités : la lutte contre les stupéfiants et la lutte contre la délinquance du quotidien, en particulier les cambriolages.\n\nNous allons encore monter d'un cran dans notre combat contre la drogue, en mettant en œuvre un nouveau plan de lutte contre les stupéfiants.\n\nNotre stratégie de harcèlement et de pilonnage contre les dealers porte ses fruits. Nous avons réussi à faire disparaître un quart des points de deal ! Alors, nous allons poursuivre avec 10 opérations place nette par semaine.\nNous devons aussi taper les dealers au porte-monnaie et leur couper les vivres. C'est pourquoi, je vous annonce que nous allons désormais geler les avoirs des trafiquants de drogue identifiés.\n\nNotre réarmement civique passe par une justice plus rapide et plus efficace.\nEnsemble, nous allons envoyer un message clair : l'impunité, c'est fini !\nNous avons décidé de moyens exceptionnels pour notre Justice. Ils seront au rendez-vous.\n\nNous allons améliorer le fonctionnement de la Justice, avec plus de magistrats et de greffiers. Avec une organisation plus respectueuse de nos concitoyens, et une nouveauté : désormais, les Français ne seront plus convoqués sur des créneaux pouvant courir sur une demi-journée entière, mais sur un créneau horaire bien défini. C'est aussi par ce type de mesures et de preuves de respect que l'on renoue le lien entre la justice et les justiciables.\n\nEnfin, notre réarmement civique, c'est renforcer l'unité républicaine de notre jeunesse. C'est permettre à tous les jeunes de France de faire Nation. C'est le rôle même du Service national universel. Je lance les travaux en vue de sa généralisation à la rentrée scolaire 2026.\n\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nParler de nos services publics, c'est aussi parler de nos territoires. Chacun n'a pas les mêmes défis, les mêmes attentes, les mêmes besoins.\nJ'évoquerai demain longuement, devant le Sénat, ma stratégie pour nos territoires.\n\nJe veux d'ores et déjà, ici, puisque vous êtes aussi élus de circonscriptions et pour un bon nombre d'entre vous, élus locaux comme moi, vous dire quelles sont nos engagements. Mon Gouvernement sera toujours à l'écoute des territoires et des élus locaux. Toutes les solutions se construiront avec eux.\nJe peux vous assurer, aussi, que nous chercherons toujours des solutions adaptées aux réalités du terrain, en ayant recours à la différenciation, à l'adaptation des normes.\nNous continuerons à avancer. C'est le sens de la mission confiée à Eric WœRTH, qui nous remettra ses propositions dans les prochains mois.\n\nNous chercherons, ensemble, un chemin pour une autonomie de la Corse dans la République, comme s'y est engagé le Président de la République.\n\nMais alors que je parle de différenciation, j'ai une pensée pour les territoires d'Outre-mer – où elle s'impose tout particulièrement.\nY réarmer nos services publics y est peut-être encore plus crucial, plus vital qu'ailleurs.\nLes Outre-mer sont un atout déterminant pour notre pays. Il y a dans chaque territoire d'Outre-mer, l'enthousiasme de notre jeunesse et la détermination à réussir l'avenir.\nMais nos Outre-mer concentrent aussi tous les défis : contre la vie chère, pour l'emploi, pour la sécurité, pour la santé, l'école, la lutte contre l'immigration illégale et la transition écologique.\nChacune de nos politiques publiques doit tenir compte des spécificités des Outre-mer. J'y tiens.\nEt pour faire face aux enjeux exceptionnels auxquels son territoire est confronté, nous déposerons une loi sur Mayotte.\n\nJe veux ici avoir un mot particulier pour la Nouvelle-Calédonie. Je souhaite que le processus politique en cours aboutisse. J'y veillerai et vous examinerez dans quelques semaines un projet de loi constitutionnel sur l'avenir de la Nouvelle-Calédonie.\n\nMadame la Présidente,\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nEnsemble, je vous propose d'accélérer encore notre transition écologique.\nLe dérèglement climatique, ce ne sont pas seulement quelques degrés de plus.\nCe sont des vies détruites par les intempéries.\nCe sont des exploitations agricoles menacées – et avec elles, toute notre capacité à nous nourrir.\nCe sont des maisons et des immeubles menacés par la montée des eaux, fissurés par les mouvements des sols.\n\nFace à ces constats, certains voudraient une écologie de la brutalité.\nPour eux, l'écologie doit être punitive, douloureuse, passer par la désignation de bouc-émissaires et par la décroissance.\nLa décroissance, c'est la fin de notre modèle social. C'est la pauvreté de masse. Jamais, je ne l'accepterai.\n\nJe crois, au contraire, qu'on ne fera pas l'écologie contre le peuple.\n\nJe crois, au contraire, qu'il faut entendre les inquiétudes des Français – de tous les Français.\nIl faut entendre les agriculteurs, qui s'inquiètent de l'avenir de leur métier.\nIl faut entendre les élus locaux, qui veulent développer leurs communes.\nIl faut entendre les millions de Français, des villes moyennes, des petites communes et de la ruralité, pour qui la voiture est gage de travail et de liberté.\n\nL'écologie sans le peuple, c'est paver le chemin aux crises sociales et aux renoncements.\nAu contraire, nous allons continuer à bâtir ensemble, une écologie populaire.\nUne écologie à la Française, avec les Français et pour les Français.\nC'est tout le sens de la planification écologique qui protègera la biodiversité et permettra une baisse radicale de nos gaz à effet de serre : une baisse de 55% d'ici 2030 !\n\nUne écologie populaire, c'est une écologie où chacun agit à la hauteur de ses moyens.\nC'est pourquoi l'État sera exemplaire.\nC'est pourquoi nous continuerons d'aider les entreprises à participer activement à l'effort.\nJe suis fier que les 50 sites industriels les plus émetteurs, 50 sites qui représentent à eux-seuls 10% des émissions de gaz à effet de serre en France, se soient tous engagés à réduire leurs émissions de près de moitié d'ici 2030.\nJe vous annonce que nous lancerons une initiative similaire, contre la pollution plastique, pour les 50 sites qui mettent le plus d'emballages plastiques sur le marché.\n\nUne écologie populaire, c'est une écologie des solutions.\nLe Président de la République s'était engagé à lancer une offre de véhicule électrique pour moins de 100 euros par mois. Cet engagement est tenu et le succès est déjà au rendez-vous.\nLe Président de la République s'était engagé à développer les RER métropolitains et à investir massivement dans le ferroviaire. Cet engagement, lui aussi, nous le tiendrons.\n\nUne écologie populaire, c'est une écologie de la croissance et de l'emploi.\nLe retour de l'industrie, les investissements en faveur de la décarbonation grâce à France 2030, les métiers de la rénovation thermique ou le secteur de l'économie circulaire… : oui, la transition écologique regorge d'opportunités, de secteurs en croissance et de filières nouvelles. Oui, nous ferons rimer climat avec croissance.\n\nUne écologie populaire, c'est une écologie qui se construit au plus près des réalités des Français et des territoires.\nDes concertations sont en cours, partout en France, aux côtés des élus locaux. Nous donnerons à chacun les moyens de faire, et je souhaite que le financement de leurs plans locaux de transition écologique soit établi partout, d'ici l'été.\n\nUne écologie populaire, c'est une écologie qui protège et assure notre souveraineté.\nGrâce à la sobriété, aux énergies renouvelables et au nucléaire, nous allons assurer notre indépendance énergétique.\nJe veux le dire sans ambiguïté : le nucléaire est une fierté française. Le nucléaire est un atout majeur pour notre pays. J'assume pleinement d'être à la tête d'un Gouvernement pro-énergie nucléaire, avec une majorité pro-énergie nucléaire.\nNous allons continuer la montée en puissance de notre parc nucléaire, investir massivement dans les programmes – et cette année, l'EPR de Flamanville sera opérationnel.\nC'est aussi grâce au nucléaire que nous pouvons garantir les meilleurs prix aux Français. Nous protégerons mieux les consommateurs et régulerons les prix de l'électricité afin qu'ils se rapprochent des coûts de production.\nNous continuerons à développer les énergies renouvelables, comme nous agissons pour le nucléaire dans notre pays.\n\nEnfin, Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, bâtir une écologie populaire, c'est répondre aux aspirations de notre jeunesse.\nRéussir la transition écologique est le défi de notre génération. Notre jeunesse veut s'engager, participer, aider. Elle se demande comment être utile pour la planète. C'est pourquoi nous lancerons un Service civique écologique, qui rassemblera d'ici la fin du quinquennat 50 000 jeunes prêts à s'engager concrètement pour le climat.\n\nJ'ajoute que si nous devons réduire nos émissions et protéger notre biodiversité, nous devons aussi nous adapter au dérèglement climatique.\nNous adapter, c'est nous préparer. C'est veiller à ce que chacun, même les plus fragiles soit prêts face aux ravages du dérèglement climatique.\nNous présenterons dès ce trimestre un nouveau plan d'adaptation au changement climatique. Il proposera des solutions adaptées à chaque territoire, notamment dans les Outre-mer.\nEnfin, je vous annonce nous ferons évoluer le régime de catastrophe naturelle pour le moderniser et éviter que certains assureurs n'abandonnent les territoires les plus à risques.\n\nEnfin, je l'ai déjà évoqué et je tenais à y revenir, nous devons mener notre réarmement agricole.\nProduire et protéger pour notre souveraineté, voilà mon approche.\n\nDepuis 2017, nous avons engagé ce combat de la souveraineté et du revenu. C'est le sens des plans de filière, des différentes lois EGALIM, du Varenne de l'eau.\nNous avons débloqué 250 millions d'euros pour trouver des alternatives aux pesticides, c'est un effort inédit.\nSur l'Union Européenne, nous avons toujours été moteurs sur la réciprocité et les clauses-miroirs, et nous les ferons respecter.\nProduire, c'est d'abord donner du temps à nos agriculteurs pour passer plus de temps dans leurs champs et moins devant leurs écrans.\nProduire, c'est être souverains : je souhaite que cet objectif de souveraineté alimentaire soit clairement inscrit dans la loi.\n\nProtéger, aussi.\n\nProtéger face aux crises climatiques et sanitaires. Le Gouvernement l'a toujours fait, lors du gel, des sécheresses, de la grippe aviaire. Nous avons adopté une réforme de l'assurance récolte sans précédent avec un budget historique. Nous continuerons à le faire.\n\nProtéger face à la concurrence déloyale. C'est le combat pour la réciprocité et les mesures miroirs que je vais continuer à mener avec détermination. Ce combat il doit se mener en Europe, comme nous l'avons fait sur les médicaments vétérinaires.\n\nMais nous devons aller plus loin. Changer de logique.\nJ'assume de dire que tout ne sera pas réglé en quelques semaines, j'assume de dire que les chantiers sont complexes et que pour certains il faudra y travailler encore et encore.\nJ'assume aussi d'apporter des réponses rapides partout là où c'est possible.\n\nTrès concrètement :\n- Sur Egalim : dès la semaine dernière, 100 inspecteurs de la DGCCRF supplémentaires ont commencé leurs contrôles sur le terrain, qui seront deux fois plus nombreux qu'auparavant. C'est une vague de contrôles sans précédent.\n- Sur la trésorerie des exploitants, nous avançons dès la semaine prochaine.\no Dès février, 50% du remboursement TICPE sera versé aux exploitants, soit 733€ par exemple pour une exploitation utilisant 7 000 litres de GNR.\no Dès la semaine prochaine, le 5 février précisément, un guichet pour la prise en charge des frais vétérinaires concernant la MHE sera ouvert. Il permettra de verser les premières indemnisations dès la fin du mois de février. Le taux de prises en charge des frais vétérinaires a été réévalué à 90%.\no D'ici le 15 mars, toutes les aides PAC seront versées sur les comptes bancaires des exploitants. Et nous travaillerons avec les régions pour que les aides à l'installation des jeunes agriculteurs puissent être versées dans les prochaines semaines.\no Et la semaine dernière, le fonds d'urgence Bretagne a été doublé.\n\n- Sur la simplification. J'en parlais tout à l'heure, 10 premières normes sont simplifiées. Nous allons continuer le travail au niveau local. Et tout ce que nous pouvons faire dès maintenant, nous le ferons.\n\nD'ores et déjà, je peux vous dire que nous avons avancé ces tout derniers jours avec les agriculteurs et leurs représentants, et ce, sur 5 sujets.\n- Sur l'élevage : nous avons mis en œuvre un dispositif fiscal qui leur permette de faire face à l'inflation, notamment sur le prix de leurs bêtes. Et bien nous le renforcerons, pour protéger toujours davantage nos éleveurs.\n- Sur Egalim, là, c'est très clair. J'ai déjà parlé des amendes et des contrôles, mais je peux vous dire que toutes les amendes qui seront infligées à l'industrie et à la grande distribution, elles seront réutilisées pour soutenir financièrement les agriculteurs.\n- Sur la viticulture : oui, nos viticulteurs souffrent. Mais notre filière viticole est notre fierté, elle fait rayonner la France. Et donc je vous annonce que nous allons débloquer dans les prochains jours des moyens nouveaux avec un fonds d'urgence avant la fin de la semaine pour soutenir nos viticulteurs, particulièrement en Occitanie.\n- Sur les contrôles : je lance aujourd'hui un grand plan de contrôle sur la traçabilité des produits. L'objectif est clair : garantir une concurrence équitable ! Notamment pour que les normes qu'on applique aux agriculteurs français soient aussi respectées pour les marchandises étrangères.\n- Au niveau européen, nos 3 priorités immédiates sont claires : les jachères, les importations ukrainiennes, notamment de volailles, et le MERCOSUR. Ces sujets sont portés très fortement par le Gouvernement et le Président de la République lui-même. Nous nous sommes engagés. Nous avons engagé une coalition de 22 pays sur la question des jachères et nous sommes proches d'aboutir à une nouvelle prolongation de la dérogation. Nous ne nous laisserons pas faire. Nous prendrons également des mesures pour éviter toutes surtransposition, d'où qu'elles viennent.\nJe le sais, nous ne sommes pas au bout du chemin. Il y aura de nouvelles conquêtes dans les jours qui viennent, je pense notamment aux jeunes agriculteurs et à la transmission des exploitations.\nMais nous agissons vite, fort, avec détermination et respect pour nos agriculteurs.\n\nMadame la Présidente,\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nRéarmer la France, c'est continuer à conquérir de nouveaux droits.\n\nLe Président de la République a fait de l'égalité entre les femmes et les hommes, la grande cause de ses quinquennats.\nElle sera au cœur des engagements de mon Gouvernement.\n\nC'est le sens de la réforme du congé parental, annoncée par le Président de la République.\nAujourd'hui, le congé parental ne laisse pas assez de revenus aux familles.\nBien souvent, il est inégalement réparti dans le couple, et éloigne durablement les femmes de l'emploi.\nAlors, comme toutes les inégalités, nous devons la combattre.\nAussi, le congé parental sera transformé en congé de naissance de 6 mois au total, mieux rémunéré, et que les parents se répartiront entre eux.\n\nConquérir de nouveaux droits, c'est reconnaître et défendre sans relâche le droit des femmes à disposer de leur corps. Nous inscrirons le droit à l'interruption volontaire de grossesse, au sein de notre texte fondamental, au sein de la Constitution.\n\nConquérir de nouveaux droits, enfin, c'est être aux côtés de nos concitoyens jusqu'au bout de la vie.\nLa fin de vie est sans doute l'une des questions les plus intimes et les plus délicates qui soit.\nC'est se pencher sur son histoire. C'est repenser aux souffrances endurées par certains. C'est s'interroger sur soi-même, sur ce que l'on voudrait face à l'insupportable et l'irréversible, face à l'irréparable.\nOn ne peut légiférer sur la fin de vie qu'avec la plus grande prudence, la plus grande retenue et le plus grand respect.\nAujourd'hui, nos compatriotes appellent à revoir notre droit.\nC'est une demande des familles. C'est une demande des malades. C'est un appel grave, auquel nous devons répondre.\nNous y répondrons.\nNous renforcerons considérablement les unités de soins palliatifs dans notre pays, avec une unité par département. Avant l'été, nous examinerons, un projet de loi sur l'aide active à mourir dans notre pays.\nCe débat animera notre société, je le sais. Je souhaite qu'il puisse se tenir dans une volonté d'équilibre et dans le respect des convictions de chacun.\n\nMadame la Présidente,\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nJe viens de tracer les grandes orientations que suivra mon Gouvernement.\n\nEn suivant ce chemin, je propose aux Français d'avoir pleinement le contrôle de leurs vies.\n\nJe souhaite que la France retrouve pleinement la maîtrise de son destin. Qu'elle soit pleinement souveraine.\n\nUne souveraineté industrielle, technologique et numérique, créatrice d'innovations et d'emplois.\nUne souveraineté énergétique, qui nous protégera des crises, protègera l'environnement et garantira des prix plus bas aux Français.\nUne souveraineté agricole, qui nous permettra de nourrir notre pays avec les meilleurs produits et d'assurer l'avenir de notre agriculture.\n\nUne souveraineté culturelle, où notre création et notre patrimoine sont soutenus. Où notre exception culturelle est protégée. Où la culture est accessible à tous.\n\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nJe parle de souveraineté nationale, mais c'est aussi par l'Europe que nous parviendrons à la consolider.\n\nDepuis 2017 et le discours de la Sorbonne du Président de la République, l'Europe a changé. Elle a surmonté les crises et pris ses responsabilités.\nC'est grâce à l'Europe, que nous avons pu avoir des vaccins face à l'épidémie.\nGrâce à l'Europe, que nous avons bénéficié d'un plan de relance massif.\nGrâce à l'Europe, que nous soutenons l'Ukraine depuis le premier jour de la guerre, face à l'agression russe.\nGrâce à l'Europe, que nous avons imposé des normes aux géants du numériques.\nGrâce à l'Europe, que nous avons instauré un impôt minimal sur les sociétés pour lutter contre l'optimisation fiscale.\nGrâce à l'Europe, que nous contrôlons mieux nos frontières, grâce au Pacte sur la migration et l'asile. Un pacte que je peux résumer en une phrase : nous contrôlons enfin qui peut entrer dans l'espace Schengen et qui ne le peut pas.\nGrâce à l'Europe, aussi, que nous investissons massivement dans des secteurs stratégiques et pour notre industrie.\n\nCeux qui prônent la fin de l'application des traités sont les partisans d'un Frexit déguisé, qui affaiblirait la France.\nMoins d'Europe, c'est moins de puissance pour la France.\nJe ne prendrai qu'un exemple : le Brexit !\nSes partisans promettaient des jours heureux à l'économie britannique et au peuple anglais. La semaine dernière, à cause du Brexit, les derniers hauts-fourneaux de Grande-Bretagne ont fermé et on ne produit plus d'acier au Royaume-Uni !\nNous, en France, au contraire, notamment grâce aux investissements de l'Europe, l'industrie revient !\n\nQui étaient les premiers soutiens du Brexit ?\nQui, a baptisé dans les villes qu'il dirige, des rues « Rue du Brexit » ?\nQui s'est affiché ouvertement avec le leader du camp du Brexit ?\nC'est le Rassemblement National !\nL'Europe. Eternel bouc émissaire de ceux qui, faute de pouvoir diriger un pays, veulent toujours détruire un continent. Pas un Français ne pense que nous\n\npouvons nous passer d'Europe. Pas un Français, non plus, ne pense que l'Europe a su pleinement trouver la place juste dans sa vie. Ils ont raison. Tout n'est pas parfait, et il reste des chantiers à mener.\nMais les faits sont là : avec l'Europe, notre puissance est démultipliée. Et ces dernières années, nous avons commencé à la changer.\n\nEt je le dis solennellement, à l'heure où il est minuit moins une dans le siècle, face aux impérialismes, les masques devront tomber. On peut vouloir changer l'Europe pour l'intérêt du pays, et nous le faisons. Mais on ne peut pas vouloir sortir de l'Europe, sauf à avoir d'autres intérêts, sauf à servir un autre pays, une autre puissance.\n\nMadame la Présidente,\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nVoilà les grands principes qui guideront mon action, celle de mon Gouvernement, pour la France et pour les Français.\nPour notre France qui n'a jamais perdu son ambition de grandeur.\nPour ces Français qui n'ont jamais manqué à leurs devoirs.\nCes axes que je vous ai présentés, ils sont une réponse aux enjeux de la Nation.\nProbablement pas la seule. Mais le reflet de l'ambition que nous portons avec le Président de la République.\nIls correspondent aussi aux rêves qu'une génération avait appris à ne plus porter.\nTrouver un emploi stable.\nAcheter un logement.\nFonder une famille.\nFaire des sacrifices mais acceptables s'ils servent à l'ascension de leurs enfants.\nAimer les paysages, une culture commune, une société libre et tenue.\nDans une époque si difficile, il n'y a pas de réponse simple. Mais il y a des espoirs tranquilles à raviver.\n\nJ'assumerai toujours de débattre avec vous. Je respecterai toujours vos opinions, vos propositions.\nJe ne rejetterai jamais la critique, tant qu'elle est constructive.\nCes mots, je les adresse à vous, et je les adresse aux Français. Je sais leurs attentes, je sais qu'ils ne me pardonneront rien.\nLes temps sont troublés, les doutes sont nombreux, mais l'espoir est là.\n\nLa France est puissante.\nParce que ce qui nous réunit est toujours plus fort que ce qui nous divise.\nParce que la France, notre pays, notre Nation, notre terre, demeureront notre fierté.\nParce-que oui, être Français, en 2024, oui, c'est une fierté. Notre société est plus ouverte, plus audacieuse, plus pionnière que l'image que nous nous renvoyons parfois à nous-mêmes.\n\nÊtre Français en 2024, c'est vivre dans un pays où l'histoire s'écrit.\n\nÊtre Français en 2024, c'est vivre dans un pays qui n'a pas renoncé au progrès social, à protéger les droits de tous et surtout de toutes, et à en conquérir de nouveaux.\n\nÊtre Français en 2024, c'est vivre dans un pays dont l'honneur est de se battre pour la stabilité du monde, pour la justice et pour la paix.\nÊtre Français en 2024, c'est – dans un pays qui, il y a 10 ans seulement, se déchirait autour du mariage pour tous – pouvoir être Premier ministre en assumant son homosexualité.\n\nDe tout cela, je vois la preuve que notre pays bouge. La preuve que les mentalités évoluent. La preuve que nous n'avons aucune raison de céder à la fatalité.\nAlors, je n'ai qu'une chose à dire à nos concitoyens, quelle que soit leur couleur de peau, leur origine, leur adresse ou leurs croyances : la France est votre pays ; et, en France, tout est possible !\n\nMadame la Présidente,\nMesdames et messieurs les députés,\n\nOui, nous sommes fiers d'être français et, avec vous, je veux faire briller cette fierté française !\n\nJe viens de vous présenter le cap de mon Gouvernement.\nLe cap pris sous l'autorité du Président de la République, pour reprendre pleinement notre destin en main et restaurer notre souveraineté.\n\nEt aujourd'hui, nous sommes prêts.\nPrêts à voir la vérité en face.\n\nPrêts à écouter et prêts à entendre la voix de tous les Français.\nPrêts à agir.\n\nPrêts à œuvrer sans relâche, fidèles à notre devise républicaine.\nPrêts à garantir la Liberté.\nA œuvrer pour plus d'Egalité.\nA toujours choisir la Fraternité.\n\nParce que, Madame la Présidente, Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, nous ne sommes pas n'importe quel pays.\nNous ne serons jamais une puissance moyenne, qui se résignerait au déclin avec fatalité.\nNous ne sommes pas condamnés à subir, mais déterminés à agir.\nDéterminés à prendre notre destin en main.\nDéterminés, Madame la Présidente, Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, parce que sommes la France et que rien ne résiste au peuple français !\n\nJe vous remercie.\n\nSource https://www.gouvernement.fr, le 31 janvier 2024"

Quand le doute glace, quand il fige, quand il conduit à douter non-pas de l'avenir qui se dessine, mais à douter de soi-même, de ses forces et de ses capacités.\n\nJe suis né en 1989, l'année du bicentenaire de la Révolution.\nUne année, 89, où l'on a cru que la démocratie libérale et le progrès universel triompheraient par eux-mêmes.\n\nMa génération a vu l'inverse se produire. Parce que notre génération, partout dans le monde, voit son monde chamboulé plus fortement encore que toute autre avant elle. Elle est en proie au doute.\n\nDoute sur l'avenir de sa planète.\nDoute sur son identité.\nDoute, ici, en France, sur qui nous sommes, comme peuple et comme Nation.\nDoute sur notre modèle social, sur nos services publics, sur notre démocratie.\n\nNotre responsabilité, celle de chacune et chacun d'entre nous, c'est de puiser en nous la force d'identifier tous les ressorts pour les surpasser.\nSi nous sommes là, ici réunis, si nous nous engageons, par-delà nos divergences et nos désaccords, c'est que nous avons un point commun, partagé par des dizaines de millions de nos concitoyens : nous voyons davantage de raisons d'espérer que de douter.\n\nC'est parce que nous sommes prêts à affronter pour avancer. Affronter pour avancer.\n\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nEn m'exprimant face à vous, c'est en réalité à chaque citoyen de notre pays que je m'adresse.\nEt à travers vous, c'est à chacun de nos concitoyens que je veux le dire : nous ne sommes pas n'importe quel pays.\nLa France n'a jamais été, n'est pas, ne sera jamais une Nation qui subit : ni hier, ni aujourd'hui, ni demain.\n\nDans les pires moments de doute, de désarroi, de désunion, elle a montré sa solidité, son supplément d'âme qui fait d'elle une Nation à nulle autre pareille.\nEn cette année 2024, nous commémorerons les 80 ans du débarquement, moment de libération d'une France, de soutien à des Français qui pour la plupart n'avaient jamais cessé de croire en elle.\n\nEn cette année 2024, nous rouvrirons les portes de Notre-Dame de Paris, alors que l'image rétinienne des flammes reste si vive dans l'esprit des Français.\nEn cette année 2024, nous accueillerons le monde, un monde bouleversé, divisé, oui nous accueillerons le monde à l'occasion des jeux olympiques et paralympiques.\n\nLa France rime avec puissance.\nLa France, c'est un repère, un idéal.\nC'est un patrimoine, témoin d'une Histoire millénaire.\n\nC'est un héritage moral, celui de la patrie où sont nés les Droits de l'Homme. Celui d'un modèle social, protecteur et envié dans le monde entier.\n\nLa France, c'est le pays de la création – que nous soutenons et qui nous fait rayonner.\nC'est la patrie de la recherche – à laquelle nous donnons des moyens sans précédent.\nC'est la Nation de l'innovation – qui construit le monde de demain, de 2030.\n\nLa France, ce sont nos jeunes, qui osent et se lancent.\nLa France, ce sont nos familles, et toutes ces mères célibataires qui se battent, qui ne lâchent rien, jamais rien.\nCe sont nos soignants, nos professeurs, nos forces de l'ordre, tous nos agents publics, nos militaires qui s'engagent pour que quelque chose qui les dépasse.\nCe sont nos artisans qui font rayonner nos savoirs-faire.\nNos agriculteurs, nos pêcheurs, qui travaillent matin, midi et soir pour nous nourrir.\nCe sont nos élus locaux, et je suis l'un des leurs depuis 10 ans, qui s'engagent et se donnent corps et âme pour leurs territoires.\nCe sont nos associations, nos bénévoles.\nLa France, c'est 68 millions de Français de l'Hexagone, des Outre-mer et de l'étranger, qui n'ont pas fini de nous surprendre.\n\nDans un monde où tout s'accélère et se transforme, je refuse, avec eux, que notre identité puisse se diluer ou se dissoudre.\nLa France a son rang à tenir, sa voix à faire entendre, sa singularité à imposer.\nNous avons une fierté française à maintenir. Une fierté européenne à consolider.\n\nAffronter pour avancer.\n\nLes difficultés économiques, les bouleversements climatiques, démographiques, géopolitiques, ne nous figeront jamais, ne nous conduiront jamais à nous perdre.\nIls ne signifient pas la fin de tout, mais le passage d'un monde à un autre.\nUn passage difficile, douloureux, inquiétant à bien des égards.\nMais un passage que nous réussirons. J'en suis intimement convaincu.\nÀ ceux qui veulent y voir notre disparition, j'y vois notre renaissance, parce que nous avons une identité et des valeurs. À ceux qui veulent y voir un triangle des Bermudes, j'y vois notre Cap Horn, parce que nous savons où nous voulons aller. À ceux qui veulent y voir une perte de boussole, j'y vois une détermination, parce que j'ai confiance.\n\nConfiance, parce que je connais le chemin que nous avons parcouru depuis 2017, les tabous que nous avons levés, les obstacles que nous avons franchis.\nJ'ai confiance parce que je connais les Français, leur énergie, leur volonté, leur créativité.\n\nJ'ai confiance, parce que face aux épreuves, aux inquiétudes et aux crises, notre pays s'est toujours relevé.\n\nL'épidémie de Covid a mis à jour bon nombre des fractures de notre société. Elle a poussé notre modèle social dans ses retranchements. Mais notre pays a tenu, et nous avons protégé nos concitoyens mieux que beaucoup d'autres ne l'ont fait.\n\nLe dérèglement climatique nous frappe, plus dur, plus fort, plus souvent. L'exceptionnel devient la norme. Les catastrophes se multiplient. Mais notre pays agit avec force, et jamais dans son Histoire, les émissions de gaz à effet de serre n'ont baissé aussi rapidement que l'an dernier !\n\nLa guerre en Ukraine a ébranlé l'Europe. Elle a détruit le rêve d'une paix éternelle sur notre continent. Elle nous a rappelé durement, que la démocratie était fragile, et la liberté un idéal toujours à défendre. Mais notre pays, notre Europe, ont montré le visage de la détermination face à l'agresseur et sa solidarité pour le peuple ukrainien !\n\nL'attaque terroriste monstrueuse en Israël et la guerre au Proche-Orient ont ravivé des plaies et des maux, jusque dans notre société. Mais notre pays a su se dresser, répondre par le refus de la haine et par l'unité !\n\nLa crise énergétique, l'inflation, la menace terroriste : les crises se superposent, s'enchevêtrent et s'additionnent. Elles n'offrent aucune solution miraculeuse. Mais méthodiquement, avec les Français, nous y répondrons !\n\nBien sûr, face à ces crises, pour beaucoup de Français, l'avenir est davantage une crainte et qu'une promesse.\nEt encore trop de Français ont le sentiment de perdre le contrôle de leur propre vie.\n\nAvec le Président de la République, avec mon Gouvernement, je ne m'y résous pas. Je ne m'y résoudrai jamais.\n\nPour tous ces Français, nous allons continuer à affronter pour avancer.\nPas par des belles paroles, des grandes tirades ou de beaux discours.\nMais par des actes. Rapides et concrets. De nouveaux changements dans leur vie et sur le terrain.\n\nMadame la Présidente,\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nSous l'égide du Président de la République, l'identité même de cette majorité, de ce Gouvernement, c'est de reconquérir notre souveraineté française et européenne !\n\nNotre promesse aux Français est claire : oui, nous voulons reprendre notre destin en main !\nEn ouvrant une nouvelle page de cette conquête, nous pouvons nous appuyer sur un bilan concret, solide, tangible.\n\nEn 2017, ma génération n'avait connu que la désindustrialisation qui semblait inéluctable, le chômage de masse qui s'ancrait, l'Europe qui se désunissait, la transition écologique qui rimait avec nécessité plus qu'avec réalité.\n\nAu fond, en 2017, la souveraineté de la France et de l'Europe était pour beaucoup un impensé. Pour certains même, c'était un gros mot.\n\nNous avons assumé de parler de souveraineté, et plus important encore : nous avons assumé d'en faire la matrice de notre action. Et nous avons agi.\nNous avons engagé une action résolue pour la souveraineté économique avec, pour la première fois, le retour de l'industrie sur notre sol – n'en déplaise aux Cassandre, il y a désormais plus d'usines qui ouvrent que d'usines qui ferment en France, plus d'emplois industriels qui y sont créés que détruits, ça n'était pas arrivé depuis 30 ans. Notre taux de chômage est descendu jusqu'à un niveau jamais atteint depuis 25 ans, et pour la 5ème année consécutive, notre pays est le plus attractif d'Europe pour les investissements étrangers.\n\nNous avons engagé une action résolue pour lutter contre le réchauffement climatique et conquérir notre indépendance énergétique, avec une planification écologique inédite dans le monde, et une stratégie énergétique pour une énergie plus souveraine et plus durable.\n\nNous avons engagé une action résolue pour la souveraineté de nos frontières, avec une loi immigration et un pacte asile-immigration au niveau européen enfin réellement protecteurs pour notre pays.\n\nNous avons engagé une action résolue, et elle prendra du temps, pour que chaque Française et chaque Français puisse garder le contrôle de sa propre vie. Qu'ils ne soient jamais entravés, jamais assignés à résidence, jamais résignés.\n\nEt, évidemment, nous avons engagé une action résolue pour la souveraineté agricole de notre pays.\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés, je le dis ici dès le début de mon intervention : notre agriculture est notre force. Pas simplement parce qu'elle nous alimente au sens propre du terme. Mais parce qu'elle constitue l'un des fondements de notre identité, de nos traditions. Parce que nos agriculteurs incarnent des valeurs fondamentales et qui lorsqu'elles sont bridées, fragilisent l'ensemble de la société. Je pense à la valeur du travail, à l'effort, à la liberté d'entreprendre.\n\nNotre agriculture est notre force, et notre fierté aussi. Alors je le dis ici solennellement : il doit y avoir une exception agricole française.\n\nJe suis lucide, face à l'empilement des normes, face aux décisions qui tombent d'en haut et qui parfois tombent d'on ne sait où, elle doute, elle aussi, et attend des réponses et des solutions.\n\nNous serons au rendez-vous. Sans ambiguïté.\n\nMadame la Présidente,\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nDevant vous, je prends la parole, humble face à l'ampleur de la tâche à accomplir.\n\nJe veux m'adresser à tous les Français : ceux qui doutent et ceux qui espèrent. Ceux qui écoutent et ceux qui n'y croient plus.\nJe veux m'adresser à tous ces Français, souvent de la classe moyenne, toujours au rendez-vous de leurs responsabilités, qui ne se plaignent pas alors qu'ils ont si souvent le sentiment de subir. A ces Français qui ont le sentiment d'avoir tous les devoirs, quand d'autres ont tous les droits.\n\nÀ ces Français qui ont parfois le sentiment que leur propre pays s'éloigne, qu'ils n'y ont plus vraiment leur place, alors qu'ils en sont le cœur battant.\n\nÀ ces Français de l'entre deux, trop riches pour bénéficier des aides, mais pas assez pour ne pas compter, qui ont le sentiment que les décisions se prennent sans eux et qu'elles bénéficient toujours aux mêmes.\n\nÀ ces Français qui ont parfois l'impression de vivre dans une France archipel, dont les ponts seraient sur le point de se rompre. Mais ces Français qui espèrent au fond d'eux qu'on parviendra à les réunir.\n\nÀ ces Français qui ne demandent pas la lune, mais simplement à pouvoir vivre de leur travail, éduquer leurs enfants, se soigner, et vivre en sécurité.\nJe les entends. Je les comprends. Et comme la majorité y œuvre depuis 2017, je veux leur répondre.\n\nJe le veux avec d'autant plus de détermination, que je sais le risque, pour eux, de les laisser céder à des sirènes qui ne conduiraient qu'au chaos, à la division et à l'effondrement.\nCar je suis lucide, pendant que nous agissons : certains guettent, entretiennent les colères et espèrent en récolter les fruits.\n\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nLe défi est immense et j'ai bien conscience que nous ne pourrons pas le relever seuls, avec mes ministres, que je remercie pour leur engagement sans faille.\n\nJ'ai bien conscience, aussi, du message très clair exprimé par les Français en 2022.\nNous avons une majorité, que je salue et à qui je veux dire ma confiance et ma fidélité. Mais cette majorité est relative et les Français attendent que nous cessions les querelles de principes pour échanger et pour agir ensemble.\n\nDepuis 2022, depuis 18 mois, sur bien des textes, nous y sommes parvenus. Et aujourd'hui, je le dis à la majorité comme aux oppositions : nous avons la France en partage.\n\nNous avons, je le crois, un devoir commun de transcender les clivages, les désaccords et les divisions pour œuvrer au service des Français.\nÉvidemment, nous ne serons pas d'accord sur tout.\n\nÉvidemment, nous nous opposerons, dans cet hémicycle et ailleurs.\nMais je vous le dis : je ne renoncerai jamais à dialoguer. Ma porte sera toujours ouverte. Parce qu'à travers vous, Mesdames et Messieurs les députés de oppositions, ce sont les voix de millions de Français qui s'expriment.\nMême si je ne suis pas convaincu que ces millions de Français attendent qu'on cherche à couvrir son interlocuteur par des cris pendant qu'il intervient dans l'hémicycle de l'Assemblée nationale !\n\nC'est aussi cela, la méthode que je veux pour mon Gouvernement : respecter les Français, respecter les oppositions, respecter notre Parlement. Je m'y engage, et j'en serai le garant.\nMa méthode a toujours été la même.\nChaque Français porte une vérité sur notre pays. Nous devons l'écouter et y répondre.\nForces politiques, organisations syndicales, élus locaux, Français : depuis ma nomination, j'ai entamé des échanges, toujours avec franchise et lucidité.\nAlors, avec vous, je veux faire résonner les mots de nos concitoyens, répondre à leurs inquiétudes et porter leurs espoirs.\n\nAlors Mesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nMa priorité est claire : favoriser le travail pour que ceux qui en sont éloignés s'en rapprochent, en soutenant ceux qui n'ont que le fruit de leur travail pour vivre, et qui sont toujours au rendez-vous de leurs responsabilités.\n\nMon cap est clair : c'est celui de la souveraineté et de l'indépendance, à l'échelle individuelle, nationale et européenne.\n\nMa méthode est claire, elle reste la même : dire la vérité, même quand ça fait mal, même quand cela nous conduit à remettre en cause nos propres décisions. Dire la vérité, donc, et agir.\nAgir vraiment, agir maintenant !\n\n\nMadame la Présidente,\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nParler aux Français, c'est entendre quatre appels à l'action.\nPour le travail, pour qu'il paie mieux et toujours plus que l'inactivité – partout et pour tous.\n\nPour nos services publics, pour qu'ils soient accessibles et de qualité – partout et pour tous.\nPour l'autorité, le civisme et le respect des droits et devoirs – partout et pour tous.\nPour un environnement plus respirable – partout et pour tous.\n\nEt je veux l'affirmer : nous n'avons pas renoncé aux grandes conquêtes et à la création de droits nouveaux.\n\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nPour le travail,\nPour nos services publics et le rétablissement de l'autorité dans notre société,\nPour la transition écologique, nous partons aujourd'hui d'un bilan solide !\n\nDerrière le cap fixé par le Président de la République, nous avons multiplié les actions et les réformes.\nEt je veux ici rendre hommage à l'action déterminante d'Edouard PHILIPPE, de Jean CASTEX et d'Elisabeth BORNE, dont le sens de l'État et la détermination à faire sont des exemples.\nJe veux rendre hommage à la majorité, toujours mobilisée pour améliorer le quotidien des Français.\nJe veux saluer tous les parlementaires, qui ont accepté de sortir des logiques partisanes pour permettre l'adoption de nombreux textes.\n\nAujourd'hui, de premiers résultats sont là.\n\nDepuis 2017, nous avons montré que le chômage de masse n'était pas une fatalité.\nNous avons engagé des réformes fortes, qui avaient trop longtemps été repoussées.\nNous avons pris les ordonnances travail, dès le début du premier quinquennat.\nNous avons mené une réforme de l'assurance-chômage, une réforme de l'apprentissage, une réforme des retraites.\nNous avons lancé le contrat d'engagement jeune, baissé les impôts et les charges et engagé une réforme majeure du lycée professionnel.\n\nAujourd'hui, le chômage a baissé de plus de 2 points !\n2 millions d'emplois ont été créés !\nNotre industrie revient avec 100 000 emplois industriels créés et la réouverture de 300 usines !\n\nLe nombre d'apprentis a plus que triplé. Ils sont désormais plus de 850 000 en France et nous avons le cap du million en vue !\nDepuis 2017, nous avons agi massivement pour nos services publics.\n\nPour notre santé, avec les 19 milliards du Ségur de la santé, avec une revalorisation historique des soignants, avec l'augmentation du nombre de places dans les études de médecine, d'infirmier et d'aide-soignant !\nPour notre école, nous avons engagé des transformations majeures et agi pour l'égalité des chances. Je pense au dédoublement des classes ou encore à l'augmentation du salaire des enseignants, la plus forte depuis 30 ans.\nPour notre sécurité, nous avons investi comme jamais par le passé : 10 000 postes de policiers et gendarmes ont été créés lors du premier quinquennat. 8500 de plus le seront lors de celui-ci et nous avons lancé la création de 238 nouvelles brigades de gendarmerie. La sécurité, ça doit être pour tous, y compris dans la ruralité et dans les petites villes.\n\nDepuis 2017, pour la planète, nous avons préféré aux grands mots les vrais actes ! Nous agissons ! Et nous agissons plus qu'aucune majorité avant nous !\n\nAvant 2017, les émissions de gaz à effet de serre diminuaient de 1% en moyenne par an. Dans le premier quinquennat, elles ont baissé de 2% en moyenne par an. L'an dernier, sur les 9 premiers mois de l'année, elles ont baissé de près de 5%. C'est le crédit de notre action sur la transition écologique !\nConformément à l'engagement du Président de la République, nous avons désormais une stratégie complète, secteur par secteur, territoire par territoire : la planification écologique.\nNous nous donnons les moyens de réussir et nous investissons cette année 40 milliards d'euros pour la transition écologique !\n\nMadame la Présidente,\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nNous avons beaucoup fait, mais il reste encore du chemin.\n\nAlors avec mon Gouvernement, je suis prêt. Je suis déterminé.\n\nNous devons répondre aux inquiétudes de la classe moyenne et faire en sorte que ceux qui vont travailler puissent vivre de leur travail, et gagnent toujours plus que ceux qui ne travaillent pas.\n\nNous devons répondre aux défis des emplois non-pourvus, car il est incompréhensible que le chômage reste autour de 7%, alors qu'il y a tant d'entreprises et de filières qui cherchent à recruter partout sur le territoire national.\n\nNous avons en France un paradoxe. Nous avons un salaire minimum, un SMIC, nettement supérieur à celui de nos voisins, et nous en sommes fiers. Mais nous avons une part de nos travailleurs proches du SMIC beaucoup plus importante que nos voisins. C'est un problème.\n\nD'abord, nous agirons résolument pour que les branches professionnelles qui continuent à rémunérer en dessous du SMIC remontent ces rémunérations. C'était le cas d'une soixantaine d'entre elles l'été dernier. Grâce à la mobilisation engagée alors, nous étions descendus à une trentaine à la fin de l'année 2023. La revalorisation du SMIC au 1er janvier en a fait redescendre une partie en dessous. Je souhaite poursuivre et amplifier la mobilisation pour des résultats rapides, et je n'exclus aucune mesure pour y parvenir.\n\nEnsuite, nous devons faire évoluer un système qui nous a conduits, depuis des décennies, à concentrer nos aides, nos exonérations, au niveau du SMIC.\nAujourd'hui, pour augmenter de 100€ le revenu d'un employé au SMIC, l'employeur doit débourser 238 euros de plus.\nQuant au salarié, il perdra 39€ de prime d'activité, il voit sa CSG ses cotisations sociales augmenter de 26€ et il entre dans l'impôt sur le revenu.\nEn bref, autant le dire, notre système, fruit de réformes successives pétries de bonnes intentions ces dernières décennies, a placé notre monde économique dans une situation où il n'y a quasiment plus aucun intérêt pour quiconque à augmenter un salarié au SMIC.\n\nOn ne peut accepter une France où beaucoup sont condamnés à rester proches du SMIC toute leur carrière. La progression salariale doit, toujours, permettre de récompenser l'effort et le mérite.\nAlors oui, j'assume de le dire, il faut désmicardiser la France. Dès le prochain projet de loi de finance, en nous appuyant sur les propositions des parlementaires, des partenaires sociaux et sur un certain nombre de travaux d'experts qui sont actuellement conduits, nous commencerons à réformer ce système.\n\nDans le même temps, nous devons continuer à baisser les charges qui pèsent sur la classe moyenne. Après la suppression de la taxe d'habitation, de la redevance télé, après la baisse de 5 milliards d'euros des premières tranches de l'impôt sur le revenu, nous tiendrons l'engagement du Président de la\nRépublique d'une nouvelle baisse d'impôts de 2 milliards d'euros. Cette baisse d'impôt sera financée et la solidarité nationale devra s'exercer pour nos classes moyennes.\n\nValoriser le travail, ce n'est pas seulement pour les salariés.\n\nNous agirons aussi pour nos fonctionnaires, qui permettent à l'État d'avancer et s'engagent au service de l'intérêt général, en intégrant leur mérite et leurs efforts à leur rémunération. Un projet de loi sera déposé dès le second semestre de cette année.\n\nNous agirons pour nos indépendants, tous nos commerçants, nos artisans, nos agriculteurs qui sont indépendants. En 2026, nous aurons réformé l'assiette sociale des indépendants. Cela veut dire plus de droits, notamment plus de droits à la retraite, sans payer davantage de cotisations. C'est l'engagement de cette majorité.\n\nDeuxième objectif : pour réussir, je veux déverrouiller l'accès au travail, déverrouiller notre société.\n\nJe veux permettre à tous ceux qui le peuvent de travailler, avec en tête les droits et les devoirs de chacun.\n\nLe droit d'être mieux accompagné, grâce à la réforme de France Travail. Mais aussi le devoir de chercher un emploi.\n\nDans 18 départements, nous avons lancé une expérimentation qui conditionne le RSA à 15 heures d'activité pour l'insertion. Je vous annonce que nous généraliserons ce dispositif à tous les départements de France, d'ici le 1er janvier 2025.\n\nDe plus, nous devons aller plus loin dans la réforme de l'assurance chômage.\nUne négociation a été lancée en faveur de l'emploi des seniors, de la prévention de l'usure professionnelle, des parcours et des reconversions, et nous souhaitons qu'elles aboutissent à un résultat ambitieux.\nMais la situation économique évolue. Parce que nous gardons notre objectif de plein-emploi et que nous devons inciter toujours plus à la reprise du travail, je serai extrêmement attentif à l'évolution de la trajectoire financière de l'assurance-chômage.\nSi cette dernière dévie, je n'hésiterai pas, comme la loi le permet, à demander aux partenaires sociaux de remettre l'ouvrage sur le métier, sur la base d'une nouvelle lettre de cadrage autour d'une ambition très claire : inciter toujours plus à la reprise du travail. Sans tabou.\n\nNous combattrons également toutes les trappes à inactivité. D'un côté en rendant les droits effectifs. Nous avons été capables de faire le prélèvement à la source. Nous serons capables de mener à bien la solidarité à la source, pour éviter les démarches inutiles et garantir la pleine justice sociale : que chacun touche l'intégralité de ce à quoi il a droit.\n\nCombattre les trappes à inactivité, c'est aussi assumer de réinterroger notre modèle. Je pense notamment à l'allocation de solidarité spécifique, qui prolonge l'indemnisation du chômage et qui permet, sans travailler, de valider des trimestres de retraite. Nous avons une conviction et une cohérence forte. Nous considérons que la retraite doit toujours rester le fruit du travail et donc nous proposerons la bascule de l'allocation de solidarité spécifique au RSA et la suppression de cette allocation.\nChercher un modèle social plus efficace et moins coûteux, ce n'est pas un gros mot, c'est un impératif.\n\nDéverrouiller le travail, c'est aussi l'adapter aux nouvelles aspirations de nos concitoyens.\n\nC'est un fait : le rapport au travail a changé. Je mesure, dans ma génération comme dans les autres, les changements de mentalité, les attentes nouvelles, sur les horaires, sur la disponibilité, sur l'équilibre entre vie professionnelle et vie familiale. Ces aspirations ne doivent pas être niées. Elles ne doivent pas être caricaturées non plus. Au risque de décevoir certains ici, personne ne demande de « droit à la paresse ».\n\nNon, ces aspirations, elles doivent être regardées pour ce qu'elles sont : notre rapport au travail, c'est notre rapport au temps. À l'équilibre personnel.\nOn ne peut pas appliquer les mêmes calques, générations après générations.\nLes attentes changent, les technologies évoluent et font apparaître de nouvelles fractures – notamment entre ceux qui peuvent télétravailler et ceux qui ne le peuvent pas-, alors les conditions de travail doivent évoluer aussi. Et l'État doit donner l'exemple.\nComme ministre des Comptes publics, j'avais décidé, contre vents et marées, d'expérimenter dans mon administration non pas la semaine de 4 jours, mais la semaine en 4 jours, sans réduction du temps de travail.\nÀ certains endroits, il y a eu peu de candidats, à d'autres, ils sont nombreux à avoir choisi d'arriver plus tôt le matin et de partir plus tard le soir pour travailler un jour de moins. Comme Premier ministre, je demande à l'ensemble de mes ministres d'expérimenter cette solution dans leurs administrations centrales et déconcentrées.\n\nOui, l'État doit donner l'exemple s'agissant de l'organisation du travail, notamment pour toutes ces personnes qui travaillent dur et se sentent invisibles. Je pense, notamment, aux personnes du ménage, parfois forcées à faire des heures de transports en commun au milieu de la nuit, tout ça pour éviter qu'elles ne travaillent en même temps que les salariés. Là aussi, je veux que l'État montre l'exemple et que, désormais, dans l'État, les personnels d'entretien de l'administration qui le souhaitent puissent travaillent aux mêmes horaires que tout le monde : aux horaires de bureau.\n\nOui, nous devons mieux prendre en compte notre rapport au temps, et nous continuerons à avancer dans le chantier du compte épargne-temps universel, véritable « sac à dos social » qui doit permettre à ceux qui le souhaitent de travailler beaucoup plus à certains moments de leur vie où ils le peuvent, notamment quand ils sont jeunes et n'ont pas encore de responsabilité familiale, pour pouvoir, ensuite, travailler moins à d'autres moments de leur vie, pour développer un projet, s'occuper de leur famille ou d'un proche qui en a besoin.\n\nDéverrouiller notre économie, c'est aussi conquérir de nouvelles libertés, refuser le principe de rente, être capable, de continuer à transformer et libérer. Un projet de loi en ce sens sera examiné au printemps.\nIl permettra notamment de déverrouiller certaines professions comme les syndics ou encore les ventes en ligne de médicaments par les pharmacies.\n\nMesdames et messieurs les députés, beaucoup d'entre vous me l'ont dit, s'il est un secteur qu'il faut déverrouiller, c'est bien le logement.\n\nLe problème du logement est clair : il tient à la fois à l'offre et à la demande. Or pouvoir se loger, acquérir son logement, c'est pour tant de Français le projet d'une vie, l'assurance d'une retraite sereine.\nEn lien avec les élus locaux, nous répondrons à cette crise du logement, en créant un choc d'offres, avec plusieurs solutions immédiates :\n\n    Nous allons simplifier massivement les normes : revoir les DPE, simplifier l'accès à MaPrimeRénov, faciliter la densification, lever les contraintes sur le zonage, accélérer les procédures.\n    Ensuite, nous désignerons dans deux semaines, 20 territoires engagés pour le logement, où nous accélèrerons toutes les procédures, comme nous avons su le faire pour l'organisation des Jeux Olympiques et paralympiques, avec comme objectif d'y créer 30 000 nouveaux logements d'ici 3 ans.\n    Nous n'hésiterons à procéder à des réquisitions pour des bâtiments vides, notamment des bâtiments de bureaux. Nous l'avons déjà fait et nous continuerons à le faire.\n    Nous continuerons à soutenir le monde du logement social. Nous avons agi pour lui en maintenant le taux du livret A, avec 1,2 milliard d'euros pour leur rénovation énergétique, avec des plans de rachat massif. Nous voulons également répondre aux causes structurelles de la crise : le coût élevé du foncier, grâce un nouveau prêt de très long terme : 2 milliards d'euros, distribués par la Banque des Territoires. Et nous allons aussi le faire évoluer.\n    Le faire évoluer pour inciter les élus à développer de nouveaux programmes. Aussi, je vous annonce que nous allons donner aux maires la main pour la première attribution dans les nouveaux logements sociaux construits sur leur commune. C'était une mesure très attendue par les élus locaux.\n    Nous allons aussi engager un chantier, une réflexion pour faire évoluer le logement social, pour qu'il réponde davantage aux classes moyennes. Vous le savez, d'ici 2025, toutes les communes soumises à la loi SRU doivent posséder au moins un quart de logements sociaux sur leur territoire. Nous proposerons d'ajouter pour une part les logements intermédiaires, accessibles à la classe moyenne, dans ce calcul des 25%.\n\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nDésmicardiser pour promouvoir le travail, dévérouiller pour libérer l'initiative et la croissance, je veux aussi débureaucratiser la France.\n\nJe veux alléger le fardeau des règles et des normes qui pèse sur ceux qui créent nos TPE et nos PME, sur tous ces Français qui travaillent sans compter et créent de l'activité et de l'emploi.\nIl a été évalué que chaque année, ce sont 60 milliards d'euros que nous perdons à cause des démarches et des complexités de notre quotidien.\nAussi, nous engagerons après l'été une nouvelle étape de la réforme du droit du travail. Avec un objectif clair : libérer les énergies de nos TPE et PME, simplifier considérablement leur quotidien et leur permettre de négocier certaines règles directement, entreprise par entreprise.\n\nMais cet élan de simplification ne doit pas se limiter au travail.\n\nPartout dans notre pays, les Français me racontent combien les normes les oppressent, les brident, les empêchent de faire et d'avancer.\nJe pense à nos agriculteurs. Je pense à tous les petits patrons. Je pense à nos élus locaux, qui croulent sous les règles et les procédures administratives.\nÀ date, le nombre de mots pour dire des normes, sur Légifrance, s'élève à 44,1 millions de mots. C'est pratiquement deux fois plus qu'il y a 20 ans.\nÀ tous les échelons, je veux débureaucratiser la France.\n\nNous évaluerons les normes qui peuvent être supprimées ou simplifiées, avec les Français, avec les professionnels, avec les élus. Nous regarderons les démarches qui peuvent être améliorées. Tous les sujets sont sur la table.\nMon seul objectif, c'est de libérer les Français ! C'est de les laisser vivre et respirer !\n\nSupprimer des normes, c'est possible : vendredi dernier, j'ai annoncé la suppression de 10 normes nationales pour nos agriculteurs – et beaucoup d'autres suivront ! Au niveau local, en Haute-Garonne, en quelques réunions sur une semaine, le préfet et les agriculteurs se sont accordés sur l'abrogation de 4 arrêtés préfectoraux. Cette logique est étendue dès cette semaine à l'ensemble des départements français.\n\nSimplifier des démarches, c'est possible, et je vous annonce que dès cette année, chacun pourra enfin porter plainte en ligne, partout sur le territoire.\n\nSimplifier pour éviter la gabegie, c'est possible, et je vous annonce une règle générale simple : tous les organes, organismes, comités ou autres, qui ne se sont pas réunis ces 12 derniers mois, seront supprimés automatiquement.\n\nEnfin, des pans entiers de notre économie demandent des simplifications encore drastiques, notamment pour accélérer le retour de notre industrie.\nPourquoi ? Parce que trop de délais, c'est moins de projets. Et donc moins d'emplois et moins de croissance.\nQuand un investisseur veut implanter un projet en Europe, quelque chose lui saute aux yeux : en France, il faut 17 mois en moyenne pour implanter un projet industriel, en Allemagne, c'est deux fois moins. Ça ne peut pas continuer !\nAvec le projet de loi industrie verte, nous avons marqué une première étape. Je vous annonce que nous déposerons un deuxième projet de loi industrie verte. Il proposera notamment de concentrer les travaux de la CNDP, uniquement sur les projets d'envergure nationale. C'est 6 mois de gagnés dans les procédures sur les autres projets.\n\nLa bureaucratie qui recule, c'est la liberté qui avance !\nJe veux libérer les Français des contraintes qui les freinent et sont autant de boulets pour notre économie.\n\nMadame la Présidente,\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nDéverrouiller, désmicardiser, débureaucratiser. Oui, mais dans un seul objectif : réarmer notre pays.\n\nJe veux le dire d'emblée, le préalable au réarmement de la France, c'est la responsabilité budgétaire.\nNous devons faire preuve d'une responsabilité exemplaire dans nos finances publiques.\nIl en va de notre souveraineté.\nIl en va de la survie de notre modèle social.\nIl en va de la protection des plus fragiles et des classes moyennes, qui seraient les premières victimes des coupes massives et des hausses d'impôts drastiques, auxquels nous serions contraints si nous ne tenons pas notre trajectoire de réduction de nos déficits et de notre dette.\nEt je le dis : pour nous, le meilleur moyen de réduire nos déficits, c'est le travail et la croissance.\nPour certains, la croissance est un gros mot et ils n'ont que le mot « taxer » à la bouche. Tout y est passé dans les propositions parlementaires ces deux dernières années ! J'étais aux premières loges en tant que ministre des Comptes publics : les heures supplémentaires des ouvriers, le patrimoine des retraités, et même les successions des petits agriculteurs ! A ceux-là je leur réaffirme : quand on taxe tout, très vite, il n'y a plus rien à taxer, et on ne taxe plus rien du tout !\n\nJe vous confirme que nous tiendrons le même cap : repasser sous les 3% de déficit public d'ici 2027, grâce à plus de croissance, plus d'activité et à la maîtrise de nos dépenses ; pas grâce à trop d'impôts. Grâce à des économies de structure, aussi.\n\nNous mettrons toutes nos forces dans la bataille. Nous allons poursuivre et renforcer les revues de dépenses, auxquelles tous les ministères et tous les secteurs de l'action publique seront associés. Les premières propositions d'économies pour le prochain PLF issues de ce travail seront annoncées dès le mois de mars, et je souhaite qu'elles donnent lieu, très vite, à des échanges avec la représentation nationale.\n\nMadame la Présidente,\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nCe réarmement que nous construisons avec le Président de la République, il a un objectif prioritaire : assurer notre souveraineté.\n\nAlors oui, nous continuerons à renforcer notre souveraineté nationale, où nos frontières sont respectées. La lutte contre l'immigration illégale doit continuer à s'intensifier. Il faut assumer d'accueillir moins pour accueillir mieux.\nNous continuerons à déployer la Border force, lancée dans les Alpes-Maritimes, qui a déjà permis plusieurs dizaines de milliers d'interpellations à la frontière italienne.\nJe tiendrai l'engagement de ma prédécesseure de réformer l'aide médicale d'État. Nous le ferons avant l'été par voie réglementaire, avec une base qui est connue : le rapport Evin – Stefanini.\n\nDéfendre notre souveraineté nationale, c'est aussi donner les moyens nécessaires à nos Armées pour protéger notre territoire et nos valeurs.\nNos militaires se battent, au péril de leur vie, pour défendre notre pays et notre République. Et dans le cadre de la loi de programmation militaire, nous tiendrons nos engagements vis-à-vis d'eux. En deux quinquennats, nous aurons doublé le budget du ministère des Armées.\nAvec vous toutes et tous, je veux rendre hommage aux femmes et aux hommes de nos Armées. Rendre hommage à ceux qui sont tombés pour nous défendre. Leur sacrifice nous oblige. Notre reconnaissance est infinie.\n\nNotre souveraineté, c'est aussi notre capacité à répondre aux besoins de nos concitoyens. Et donc, sur ces fondements, nous allons réarmer nos services publics. Ils ont toujours été une fierté. Ils doivent le rester et pour certains d'entre eux le redevenir !\nNous allons continuer à réarmer notre système de santé !\n\nEt, avec vous, je veux rendre hommage à tous les soignants de France ! Chacun à leur poste, chacun dans leur spécialité, ils sont les visages de l'engagement et de l'accompagnement ! De l'attention et de l'humanité !\n\nAujourd'hui, quel est le problème ? Malgré le travail de nos soignants, le temps médical manque. Nos compatriotes ne trouvent pas de médecins et les délais aux urgences se rallongent. Cela se traduit par la désertification de notre pays, et par la saturation de nos hôpitaux, en particulier des urgences.\n\nL'objectif est clair : plus de temps médical.\nPremier pilier : agir pour qu'il y ait plus de médecins devant les Français.\nLes effets de la suppression du numerus clausus ne se feront pas sentir immédiatement, alors nous allons mettre en œuvre des solutions fortes, tout de suite.\nC'est pourquoi, comme l'a annoncé le Président de la République, nous procèderons à la régularisation des médecins étrangers sur notre territoire.\nC'est pourquoi aussi, je vous l'annonce, je nommerai un émissaire, chargé d'aller chercher à l'étranger des médecins qui voudraient venir exercer en France. Nous devons trouver les moyens de faire revenir nos jeunes français, qui sont partis étudier à l'étranger.\nNous devons aussi, et c'est ce qu'a proposé le député NEUDER, mieux reconnaitre l'expertise et de la volonté de soignants, qui ont fait beaucoup d'études et ont une vraie expérience. Une infirmière anesthésiste, qui a un bac+5, plusieurs années de carrière et d'expérience, elle doit pouvoir si elle le souhaite entrer directement au moins en 3ème année de médecine.\n\nDeuxième pilier : agir pour qu'il n'y ait aucun territoire oublié.\nNous avons depuis 2017 déployé le service d'accès aux soins – le SAS. Il permet un progrès notable dans l'accès aux soins non programmés. Je l'ai vu encore récemment à Dijon.\nDès cet été, chaque département devra être doté d'un service d'accès aux soins, avec des professionnels organisés pour assurer la permanence des soins.\nDans les départements où il n'y aurait toujours pas de service d'accès aux soins et de réponse satisfaisante, je suis prêt à aller plus loin, en restaurant des obligations de garde pour les médecins libéraux, en soirée ou le week-end, dans leurs cabinets, à l'hôpital ou en maisons de santé.\nTroisième pilier : libérer les médecins pour qu'ils se concentrent sur le soin.\n\nNous poursuivrons les chantiers que nous avons engagés, notamment pour l'attractivité de tous les métiers du soin.\n\nNous allons accélérer le passage de 6 000 à 10 000 assistants médicaux, qui permettront aux médecins de pouvoir se consacrer davantage aux patients et moins aux formalités administratives. Cela représentera 2,5 millions de consultations libérées tous les ans pour les patients !\n\nEnsuite, nous allons poursuivre notre action en faveur de l'hôpital. Les moyens du Ségur de la santé ne sont pas encore arrivés partout. Ces lourdeurs et ces lenteurs sont insupportables. Cela changera rapidement !\n\nEnfin, il y a encore aujourd'hui trop de rendez-vous médicaux qui ne sont pas honorés.\nPour les médecins, il est insupportable d'avoir chaque jour, des patients qui ont un rendez-vous et ne se présentent pas.\nPour les Français, il est insupportable de savoir que des millions d'heures sont perdues alors qu'ils attendent parfois des mois pour un rendez-vous.\nJe souhaite un principe simple, qui se traduise par des mesures claires dès cette année : quand on a un rendez-vous chez le médecin et qu'on ne vient pas sans prévenir, on paye.\n\nProtéger nos concitoyens, c'est aussi les accompagner à tous les âges de la vie et toutes les étapes de la vie.\nNous continuerons à agir pour l'enfance, notamment l'enfance en danger.\nNous continuerons à bâtir une société où chacun peut vieillir dignement et comme il l'entend, en facilitant le maintien à domicile de ceux qui le souhaitent et en améliorant le quotidien en EHPAD. Le défi humain et financier est immense. Nous avancerons ensemble.\n\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\nParler de santé, c'est trop souvent oublier la santé mentale.\nLe mal-être, les dépressions, les pensées suicidaires ont beaucoup progressé chez nos jeunes. Je veux faire de la santé mentale de notre jeunesse une grande cause de notre action gouvernementale. Avec, là aussi, des mesures claires et immédiates.\n\nD'abord, réformer le dispositif MonSoutienPsy. Il faut être lucide : ce dispositif partait d'une bonne intention, mais il n'a pas donné les résultats escomptés. Il faut avoir le courage de le reconnaître, même si c'est nous qui l'avons mis en place. Je vous annonce donc que nous allons le rénover de fond en comble.\n\nNous allons augmenter le tarif de la consultation remboursée pour limiter au maximum le reste à charge pour les jeunes patients et leurs familles.\nPour lever tous les verrous, nous permettrons aussi aux jeunes d'avoir accès directement à un psychologue pris en charge, sans nécessairement passer par un médecin.\n\nDe plus, nous devons mailler notre territoire de maisons départementales des adolescents. Il y en a 50 aujourd'hui, je souhaite qu'il y en ait une par département.\n\nPour la santé et notamment la santé psychologique, les infirmières scolaires sont des relais essentiels auprès des élèves. Elles accomplissent un travail remarquable. Elles accompagnent les jeunes avec disponibilité, écoute et soin. Nous devons recruter davantage d'infirmières scolaires et mieux reconnaître leur engagement.\n\nAussi, je vous annonce que grâce à un budget supplémentaire issu d'un amendement porté par les groupes de la majorité dans le dernier PLF, j'ai décidé de leur verser en mai prochain une prime exceptionnelle de 800€ et de revaloriser leur salaire de 200 euros nets par mois en moyenne à compter de cette date.\nJe demande également au Gouvernement de travailler à des revalorisations pour les autres personnes sociaux et sanitaire en milieu scolaire.\n\nMadame la Présidente,\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nRenforcer nos services publics, c'est aussi agir pour notre école.\n\nJe veux ici rendre hommage à nos professeurs.\nIls s'investissent tous les jours au service de notre école, de nos élèves, et donc de notre pays.\nJ'ai souvent dit ma fierté d'être leur ministre, et aujourd'hui, comme Premier ministre, je n'oublie rien de ce que nous leur devons. Je serai toujours à leurs côtés.\n\nJe l'ai dit sur le perron de l'hôtel de Matignon, dès mes premières minutes comme Premier ministre : l'école est la mère des batailles.\n\nSur l'école, là aussi il faut partir de la réalité des faits. Pas besoin des études internationales pour cela, il suffit d'écouter les Français !\n\nQue nous disent les parents, les grands-parents d'élèves ? Que ces dernières décennies, le niveau a baissé. Que si le nombre d'heures d'absence remplacées a triplé ces derniers mois, le compte n'y est toujours pas !\n\nQue nous disent les professeurs ? Qu'ils croient en leur métier, mais qu'il est de plus en plus difficile à exercer ! Qu'ils ont parfois peur d'enseigner des pans entiers de notre Histoire ou de notre littérature !\n\nQue nous disent les jeunes qui envisagent de devenir enseignants ? Quel la formation initiale telle qu'elle est organisée ne correspond pas à leurs attentes et freine leur vocation.\n\nNous allons continuer à leur répondre !\n\nPour élever le niveau des élèves, j'ai lancé le « choc des savoirs », il doit maintenant se déployer.\nLe choc des savoirs, c'est assumer que tout le monde ne progresse pas au même rythme, que tout le monde n'a pas les mêmes facilités ou les mêmes difficultés.\nLa décision du redoublement sera désormais à la main de l'équipe pédagogique, et les groupes de niveaux commenceront à se mettre en place, dès cette année, dans nos collèges.\nUne école du passage automatique, où l'on glisse de classe en classe sans vérifier si on a le niveau pour passer dans la classe supérieure, c'est une école où tout le monde stagne et le niveau baisse. Nous assumons de porter une école des savoirs et de l'excellence, où chacun apprend à son rythme.\n\nAméliorer les savoirs, c'est aussi agir sur la question des remplacements. Nous évaluerons le Pacte enseignant et si de nouvelles mesures s'imposent, nous les prendrons.\n\nVeiller au niveau des élèves, c'est réagir face aux nouveaux défis qui le menace. Les écrans sont une catastrophe éducative et sanitaire en puissance. Nous avons d'ores et déjà interdit le portable au collège. Et comme l'a annoncé le Président de la République, nous travaillerons à mieux réguler l'usage des écrans dans et en dehors de l'École pour nos enfants.\n\nJ'ajoute qu'une école des savoirs, c'est aussi une école qui permet de se projeter dans l'avenir. Désormais, tous les élèves de seconde devront faire un stage de deux semaines. Nous continuerons à rapprocher l'école et les métiers, des administrations, des associations.\n\nUne école qui fonctionne, c'est une école où les professeurs sont mieux formés. Nous réformerons la formation des enseignants, pour construire les écoles normales du XXIe siècle. Cette réforme sera présentée d'ici au mois de mars.\n\nUne école qui marche, c'est aussi une école où les élèves sont heureux.\nTrop longtemps, le bien-être des élèves est resté un impensé.\nLe résultat, nous le connaissons : ce sont notamment les drames du harcèlement. Notre stratégie contre le harcèlement, qui a permis de briser des tabous majeurs, est très concrète : désormais, c'est l'élève harceleur qui doit quitter l'école, plus l'élève victime qui subissait une double-peine. Je suis fier que nous ayons décidé de ce changement.\n\nLe bien-être à l'école, c'est aussi donner toute leur place aux élèves en situation de handicap. Bâtir une société inclusive est au cœur des priorités de mon Gouvernement.\nCela vaut dans tous les domaines, j'y serai très attentif.\nNous accompagnerons nos concitoyens en situation de handicap en toutes circonstances. Nous leur simplifierons la vie. Nous prendrons intégralement en charge le remboursement des fauteuils roulants de ceux qui en ont besoin !\nNous agirons partout – et particulièrement à l'école.\nDepuis des années, l'État et les collectivités se renvoient la balle sur la prise en charge des AESH sur la pause du midi. Résultat, dans beaucoup d'endroits, personne ne le finance. Et la conséquence, c'est une double défaite : des élèves pas suffisamment bien accompagnés au moment du repas, et des AESH qui ne peuvent faire un temps complet pour améliorer leur rémunération.\nIl faut sortir de cette situation et je prends une décision claire : l'État prend ses responsabilités et financera désormais l'accompagnement des enfants en situation de handicap sur leur pause déjeuner. C'est un enjeu de solidarité, de dignité, de reconnaissance.\n\nRéarmer notre école, c'est réaffirmer nos valeurs.\nCar je crois que la transmission du savoir est impossible sans respect de l'autorité. Sans respect de nos valeurs républicaines – au premier rang desquelles, la laïcité.\nOn ne négocie pas avec la République. On l'accepte et on la respecte, en entier, sans mais, sans la moindre exception !\nC'est pourquoi nous soutenons l'expérimentation de l'uniforme à l'école, symbole d'égalité républicaine. Et comme l'a annoncé le Président de la République, si cette expérimentation est concluante, nous généraliserons l'uniforme en France à la rentrée 2026.\n\nJe veux le dire également : je ne peux pas me résoudre à ce que certains professeurs craignent d'aborder certains chapitres du programme.\nÀ la moindre entorse à notre pacte républicain, il y doit y avoir des décisions fortes et des sanctions fermes. Cela doit nous conduire à revoir l'échelle des sanctions dans nos établissements scolaires pour ne rien laisser passer.\n\nL'école sera le fer de lance du réarmement civique demandé par le Président de la République. Comme il s'y est engagé, le nombre d'heures d'instruction civique sera doublé au collège.\n\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nRéussir le réarmement civique, c'est au cœur des priorités de mon Gouvernement.\n\nNous devons faire respecter l'autorité partout : dans les classes, dans les familles, dans les rues.\n\nCe respect s'apprend à l'école, je le disais.\n\nCe respect de l'autorité passe aussi par les familles.\n\nLes violences de juillet dernier ont profondément marqué notre pays. Parmi les émeutiers, des jeunes, très jeunes parfois, qui semblaient avoir déjà coupé les ponts avec notre société.\nQui ne respectent plus leurs parents ou pour qui la violence semble un moyen comme un autre de tromper l'ennui.\nJe ne me résoudrai jamais à ce qu'on préfère attendre avant de donner une lourde peine, alors que bien souvent, c'est très tôt qu'il aurait fallu agir.\n\nNous devons disposer de sanctions adaptées pour les mineurs de moins de 16 ans. Pour eux, on ne peut pas aujourd'hui prononcer de peine de travaux d'intérêt général. Je vous annonce que nous créerons des travaux d'intérêt éducatif, qui seront leurs équivalents et seront données plus facilement que les peines d'intérêt général.\nCela fera partie d'une revue de l'échelle des sanctions dans nos établissements scolaires. Dès le plus jeune âge, il faut en revenir à un principe simple : « tu casses, tu répares, tu salis, tu nettoies, tu défies l'autorité, tu apprends à la respecter ».\n\nNous responsabiliserons aussi davantage les parents. Dans le cadre du projet de loi sur la justice des mineurs, nous soutiendrons la mise en place de travaux d'intérêt général pour les parents de jeunes délinquants, qui se sont totalement et volontairement soustraits à leurs obligations et responsabilités parentales.\n\nMais je le dis : il est hors de question d'accabler certaines familles. Quand on est une mère seule, de plusieurs enfants dans un quartier, on peut être totalement dépassée par les évènements, et on n'est pas toujours responsable de la dérive de ses enfants. Pour elles, au contraire, cette dérive est un échec et une douleur terrible. Nous devons les aider.\n\nJe ne me résous pas à ce que nous ayons une situation, où nous avons des familles dépassées par les événements, avec des enfants qui ne respectent pas nos règles et qui sont violents d'un côté et 50 000 places d'internat disponibles, de l'autre.\nAussi, désormais, quand un jeune sera sur la mauvaise pente, plutôt que de le laisser plonger dans la délinquance, nous proposerons aux parents de le placer en internat, en y facilitant l'accès, y compris financier. Nous allons le couper de ses mauvaises fréquentations. Nous allons lui offrir un cadre, un enseignement et une chance !\n\nLe réarmement civique, c'est bien entendu le respect de la loi.\n\nNos concitoyens attendent de nous que nous agissions encore et toujours contre les violences, les trafics, les cambriolages.\nContre l'insécurité du quotidien et la délinquance.\nIls demandent de l'ordre dans nos rues.\n\nTout n'est pas une question de moyens. Il faut les mettre au service d'une stratégie plus offensive encore.\n\nComme l'a dit le Président de la République, nous allons doubler la présence policière dans les rues d'ici 2030.\n\nNous allons mener des actions coordonnées de tous les services de l'État, forces de l'ordre, éducation, services sociaux, dans certains quartiers. C'est le sens des Forces d'Actions Républicaines. Nous les déploierons fin février dans trois premiers territoires : à Maubeuge, Valence et Besançon.\nContre l'insécurité, nous nous sommes fixé deux priorités : la lutte contre les stupéfiants et la lutte contre la délinquance du quotidien, en particulier les cambriolages.\n\nNous allons encore monter d'un cran dans notre combat contre la drogue, en mettant en œuvre un nouveau plan de lutte contre les stupéfiants.\n\nNotre stratégie de harcèlement et de pilonnage contre les dealers porte ses fruits. Nous avons réussi à faire disparaître un quart des points de deal ! Alors, nous allons poursuivre avec 10 opérations place nette par semaine.\nNous devons aussi taper les dealers au porte-monnaie et leur couper les vivres. C'est pourquoi, je vous annonce que nous allons désormais geler les avoirs des trafiquants de drogue identifiés.\n\nNotre réarmement civique passe par une justice plus rapide et plus efficace.\nEnsemble, nous allons envoyer un message clair : l'impunité, c'est fini !\nNous avons décidé de moyens exceptionnels pour notre Justice. Ils seront au rendez-vous.\n\nNous allons améliorer le fonctionnement de la Justice, avec plus de magistrats et de greffiers. Avec une organisation plus respectueuse de nos concitoyens, et une nouveauté : désormais, les Français ne seront plus convoqués sur des créneaux pouvant courir sur une demi-journée entière, mais sur un créneau horaire bien défini. C'est aussi par ce type de mesures et de preuves de respect que l'on renoue le lien entre la justice et les justiciables.\n\nEnfin, notre réarmement civique, c'est renforcer l'unité républicaine de notre jeunesse. C'est permettre à tous les jeunes de France de faire Nation. C'est le rôle même du Service national universel. Je lance les travaux en vue de sa généralisation à la rentrée scolaire 2026.\n\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nParler de nos services publics, c'est aussi parler de nos territoires. Chacun n'a pas les mêmes défis, les mêmes attentes, les mêmes besoins.\nJ'évoquerai demain longuement, devant le Sénat, ma stratégie pour nos territoires.\n\nJe veux d'ores et déjà, ici, puisque vous êtes aussi élus de circonscriptions et pour un bon nombre d'entre vous, élus locaux comme moi, vous dire quelles sont nos engagements. Mon Gouvernement sera toujours à l'écoute des territoires et des élus locaux. Toutes les solutions se construiront avec eux.\nJe peux vous assurer, aussi, que nous chercherons toujours des solutions adaptées aux réalités du terrain, en ayant recours à la différenciation, à l'adaptation des normes.\nNous continuerons à avancer. C'est le sens de la mission confiée à Eric WœRTH, qui nous remettra ses propositions dans les prochains mois.\n\nNous chercherons, ensemble, un chemin pour une autonomie de la Corse dans la République, comme s'y est engagé le Président de la République.\n\nMais alors que je parle de différenciation, j'ai une pensée pour les territoires d'Outre-mer – où elle s'impose tout particulièrement.\nY réarmer nos services publics y est peut-être encore plus crucial, plus vital qu'ailleurs.\nLes Outre-mer sont un atout déterminant pour notre pays. Il y a dans chaque territoire d'Outre-mer, l'enthousiasme de notre jeunesse et la détermination à réussir l'avenir.\nMais nos Outre-mer concentrent aussi tous les défis : contre la vie chère, pour l'emploi, pour la sécurité, pour la santé, l'école, la lutte contre l'immigration illégale et la transition écologique.\nChacune de nos politiques publiques doit tenir compte des spécificités des Outre-mer. J'y tiens.\nEt pour faire face aux enjeux exceptionnels auxquels son territoire est confronté, nous déposerons une loi sur Mayotte.\n\nJe veux ici avoir un mot particulier pour la Nouvelle-Calédonie. Je souhaite que le processus politique en cours aboutisse. J'y veillerai et vous examinerez dans quelques semaines un projet de loi constitutionnel sur l'avenir de la Nouvelle-Calédonie.\n\nMadame la Présidente,\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nEnsemble, je vous propose d'accélérer encore notre transition écologique.\nLe dérèglement climatique, ce ne sont pas seulement quelques degrés de plus.\nCe sont des vies détruites par les intempéries.\nCe sont des exploitations agricoles menacées – et avec elles, toute notre capacité à nous nourrir.\nCe sont des maisons et des immeubles menacés par la montée des eaux, fissurés par les mouvements des sols.\n\nFace à ces constats, certains voudraient une écologie de la brutalité.\nPour eux, l'écologie doit être punitive, douloureuse, passer par la désignation de bouc-émissaires et par la décroissance.\nLa décroissance, c'est la fin de notre modèle social. C'est la pauvreté de masse. Jamais, je ne l'accepterai.\n\nJe crois, au contraire, qu'on ne fera pas l'écologie contre le peuple.\n\nJe crois, au contraire, qu'il faut entendre les inquiétudes des Français – de tous les Français.\nIl faut entendre les agriculteurs, qui s'inquiètent de l'avenir de leur métier.\nIl faut entendre les élus locaux, qui veulent développer leurs communes.\nIl faut entendre les millions de Français, des villes moyennes, des petites communes et de la ruralité, pour qui la voiture est gage de travail et de liberté.\n\nL'écologie sans le peuple, c'est paver le chemin aux crises sociales et aux renoncements.\nAu contraire, nous allons continuer à bâtir ensemble, une écologie populaire.\nUne écologie à la Française, avec les Français et pour les Français.\nC'est tout le sens de la planification écologique qui protègera la biodiversité et permettra une baisse radicale de nos gaz à effet de serre : une baisse de 55% d'ici 2030 !\n\nUne écologie populaire, c'est une écologie où chacun agit à la hauteur de ses moyens.\nC'est pourquoi l'État sera exemplaire.\nC'est pourquoi nous continuerons d'aider les entreprises à participer activement à l'effort.\nJe suis fier que les 50 sites industriels les plus émetteurs, 50 sites qui représentent à eux-seuls 10% des émissions de gaz à effet de serre en France, se soient tous engagés à réduire leurs émissions de près de moitié d'ici 2030.\nJe vous annonce que nous lancerons une initiative similaire, contre la pollution plastique, pour les 50 sites qui mettent le plus d'emballages plastiques sur le marché.\n\nUne écologie populaire, c'est une écologie des solutions.\nLe Président de la République s'était engagé à lancer une offre de véhicule électrique pour moins de 100 euros par mois. Cet engagement est tenu et le succès est déjà au rendez-vous.\nLe Président de la République s'était engagé à développer les RER métropolitains et à investir massivement dans le ferroviaire. Cet engagement, lui aussi, nous le tiendrons.\n\nUne écologie populaire, c'est une écologie de la croissance et de l'emploi.\nLe retour de l'industrie, les investissements en faveur de la décarbonation grâce à France 2030, les métiers de la rénovation thermique ou le secteur de l'économie circulaire… : oui, la transition écologique regorge d'opportunités, de secteurs en croissance et de filières nouvelles. Oui, nous ferons rimer climat avec croissance.\n\nUne écologie populaire, c'est une écologie qui se construit au plus près des réalités des Français et des territoires.\nDes concertations sont en cours, partout en France, aux côtés des élus locaux. Nous donnerons à chacun les moyens de faire, et je souhaite que le financement de leurs plans locaux de transition écologique soit établi partout, d'ici l'été.\n\nUne écologie populaire, c'est une écologie qui protège et assure notre souveraineté.\nGrâce à la sobriété, aux énergies renouvelables et au nucléaire, nous allons assurer notre indépendance énergétique.\nJe veux le dire sans ambiguïté : le nucléaire est une fierté française. Le nucléaire est un atout majeur pour notre pays. J'assume pleinement d'être à la tête d'un Gouvernement pro-énergie nucléaire, avec une majorité pro-énergie nucléaire.\nNous allons continuer la montée en puissance de notre parc nucléaire, investir massivement dans les programmes – et cette année, l'EPR de Flamanville sera opérationnel.\nC'est aussi grâce au nucléaire que nous pouvons garantir les meilleurs prix aux Français. Nous protégerons mieux les consommateurs et régulerons les prix de l'électricité afin qu'ils se rapprochent des coûts de production.\nNous continuerons à développer les énergies renouvelables, comme nous agissons pour le nucléaire dans notre pays.\n\nEnfin, Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, bâtir une écologie populaire, c'est répondre aux aspirations de notre jeunesse.\nRéussir la transition écologique est le défi de notre génération. Notre jeunesse veut s'engager, participer, aider. Elle se demande comment être utile pour la planète. C'est pourquoi nous lancerons un Service civique écologique, qui rassemblera d'ici la fin du quinquennat 50 000 jeunes prêts à s'engager concrètement pour le climat.\n\nJ'ajoute que si nous devons réduire nos émissions et protéger notre biodiversité, nous devons aussi nous adapter au dérèglement climatique.\nNous adapter, c'est nous préparer. C'est veiller à ce que chacun, même les plus fragiles soit prêts face aux ravages du dérèglement climatique.\nNous présenterons dès ce trimestre un nouveau plan d'adaptation au changement climatique. Il proposera des solutions adaptées à chaque territoire, notamment dans les Outre-mer.\nEnfin, je vous annonce nous ferons évoluer le régime de catastrophe naturelle pour le moderniser et éviter que certains assureurs n'abandonnent les territoires les plus à risques.\n\nEnfin, je l'ai déjà évoqué et je tenais à y revenir, nous devons mener notre réarmement agricole.\nProduire et protéger pour notre souveraineté, voilà mon approche.\n\nDepuis 2017, nous avons engagé ce combat de la souveraineté et du revenu. C'est le sens des plans de filière, des différentes lois EGALIM, du Varenne de l'eau.\nNous avons débloqué 250 millions d'euros pour trouver des alternatives aux pesticides, c'est un effort inédit.\nSur l'Union Européenne, nous avons toujours été moteurs sur la réciprocité et les clauses-miroirs, et nous les ferons respecter.\nProduire, c'est d'abord donner du temps à nos agriculteurs pour passer plus de temps dans leurs champs et moins devant leurs écrans.\nProduire, c'est être souverains : je souhaite que cet objectif de souveraineté alimentaire soit clairement inscrit dans la loi.\n\nProtéger, aussi.\n\nProtéger face aux crises climatiques et sanitaires. Le Gouvernement l'a toujours fait, lors du gel, des sécheresses, de la grippe aviaire. Nous avons adopté une réforme de l'assurance récolte sans précédent avec un budget historique. Nous continuerons à le faire.\n\nProtéger face à la concurrence déloyale. C'est le combat pour la réciprocité et les mesures miroirs que je vais continuer à mener avec détermination. Ce combat il doit se mener en Europe, comme nous l'avons fait sur les médicaments vétérinaires.\n\nMais nous devons aller plus loin. Changer de logique.\nJ'assume de dire que tout ne sera pas réglé en quelques semaines, j'assume de dire que les chantiers sont complexes et que pour certains il faudra y travailler encore et encore.\nJ'assume aussi d'apporter des réponses rapides partout là où c'est possible.\n\nTrès concrètement :\n- Sur Egalim : dès la semaine dernière, 100 inspecteurs de la DGCCRF supplémentaires ont commencé leurs contrôles sur le terrain, qui seront deux fois plus nombreux qu'auparavant. C'est une vague de contrôles sans précédent.\n- Sur la trésorerie des exploitants, nous avançons dès la semaine prochaine.\no Dès février, 50% du remboursement TICPE sera versé aux exploitants, soit 733€ par exemple pour une exploitation utilisant 7 000 litres de GNR.\no Dès la semaine prochaine, le 5 février précisément, un guichet pour la prise en charge des frais vétérinaires concernant la MHE sera ouvert. Il permettra de verser les premières indemnisations dès la fin du mois de février. Le taux de prises en charge des frais vétérinaires a été réévalué à 90%.\no D'ici le 15 mars, toutes les aides PAC seront versées sur les comptes bancaires des exploitants. Et nous travaillerons avec les régions pour que les aides à l'installation des jeunes agriculteurs puissent être versées dans les prochaines semaines.\no Et la semaine dernière, le fonds d'urgence Bretagne a été doublé.\n\n- Sur la simplification. J'en parlais tout à l'heure, 10 premières normes sont simplifiées. Nous allons continuer le travail au niveau local. Et tout ce que nous pouvons faire dès maintenant, nous le ferons.\n\nD'ores et déjà, je peux vous dire que nous avons avancé ces tout derniers jours avec les agriculteurs et leurs représentants, et ce, sur 5 sujets.\n- Sur l'élevage : nous avons mis en œuvre un dispositif fiscal qui leur permette de faire face à l'inflation, notamment sur le prix de leurs bêtes. Et bien nous le renforcerons, pour protéger toujours davantage nos éleveurs.\n- Sur Egalim, là, c'est très clair. J'ai déjà parlé des amendes et des contrôles, mais je peux vous dire que toutes les amendes qui seront infligées à l'industrie et à la grande distribution, elles seront réutilisées pour soutenir financièrement les agriculteurs.\n- Sur la viticulture : oui, nos viticulteurs souffrent. Mais notre filière viticole est notre fierté, elle fait rayonner la France. Et donc je vous annonce que nous allons débloquer dans les prochains jours des moyens nouveaux avec un fonds d'urgence avant la fin de la semaine pour soutenir nos viticulteurs, particulièrement en Occitanie.\n- Sur les contrôles : je lance aujourd'hui un grand plan de contrôle sur la traçabilité des produits. L'objectif est clair : garantir une concurrence équitable ! Notamment pour que les normes qu'on applique aux agriculteurs français soient aussi respectées pour les marchandises étrangères.\n- Au niveau européen, nos 3 priorités immédiates sont claires : les jachères, les importations ukrainiennes, notamment de volailles, et le MERCOSUR. Ces sujets sont portés très fortement par le Gouvernement et le Président de la République lui-même. Nous nous sommes engagés. Nous avons engagé une coalition de 22 pays sur la question des jachères et nous sommes proches d'aboutir à une nouvelle prolongation de la dérogation. Nous ne nous laisserons pas faire. Nous prendrons également des mesures pour éviter toutes surtransposition, d'où qu'elles viennent.\nJe le sais, nous ne sommes pas au bout du chemin. Il y aura de nouvelles conquêtes dans les jours qui viennent, je pense notamment aux jeunes agriculteurs et à la transmission des exploitations.\nMais nous agissons vite, fort, avec détermination et respect pour nos agriculteurs.\n\nMadame la Présidente,\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nRéarmer la France, c'est continuer à conquérir de nouveaux droits.\n\nLe Président de la République a fait de l'égalité entre les femmes et les hommes, la grande cause de ses quinquennats.\nElle sera au cœur des engagements de mon Gouvernement.\n\nC'est le sens de la réforme du congé parental, annoncée par le Président de la République.\nAujourd'hui, le congé parental ne laisse pas assez de revenus aux familles.\nBien souvent, il est inégalement réparti dans le couple, et éloigne durablement les femmes de l'emploi.\nAlors, comme toutes les inégalités, nous devons la combattre.\nAussi, le congé parental sera transformé en congé de naissance de 6 mois au total, mieux rémunéré, et que les parents se répartiront entre eux.\n\nConquérir de nouveaux droits, c'est reconnaître et défendre sans relâche le droit des femmes à disposer de leur corps. Nous inscrirons le droit à l'interruption volontaire de grossesse, au sein de notre texte fondamental, au sein de la Constitution.\n\nConquérir de nouveaux droits, enfin, c'est être aux côtés de nos concitoyens jusqu'au bout de la vie.\nLa fin de vie est sans doute l'une des questions les plus intimes et les plus délicates qui soit.\nC'est se pencher sur son histoire. C'est repenser aux souffrances endurées par certains. C'est s'interroger sur soi-même, sur ce que l'on voudrait face à l'insupportable et l'irréversible, face à l'irréparable.\nOn ne peut légiférer sur la fin de vie qu'avec la plus grande prudence, la plus grande retenue et le plus grand respect.\nAujourd'hui, nos compatriotes appellent à revoir notre droit.\nC'est une demande des familles. C'est une demande des malades. C'est un appel grave, auquel nous devons répondre.\nNous y répondrons.\nNous renforcerons considérablement les unités de soins palliatifs dans notre pays, avec une unité par département. Avant l'été, nous examinerons, un projet de loi sur l'aide active à mourir dans notre pays.\nCe débat animera notre société, je le sais. Je souhaite qu'il puisse se tenir dans une volonté d'équilibre et dans le respect des convictions de chacun.\n\nMadame la Présidente,\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nJe viens de tracer les grandes orientations que suivra mon Gouvernement.\n\nEn suivant ce chemin, je propose aux Français d'avoir pleinement le contrôle de leurs vies.\n\nJe souhaite que la France retrouve pleinement la maîtrise de son destin. Qu'elle soit pleinement souveraine.\n\nUne souveraineté industrielle, technologique et numérique, créatrice d'innovations et d'emplois.\nUne souveraineté énergétique, qui nous protégera des crises, protègera l'environnement et garantira des prix plus bas aux Français.\nUne souveraineté agricole, qui nous permettra de nourrir notre pays avec les meilleurs produits et d'assurer l'avenir de notre agriculture.\n\nUne souveraineté culturelle, où notre création et notre patrimoine sont soutenus. Où notre exception culturelle est protégée. Où la culture est accessible à tous.\n\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nJe parle de souveraineté nationale, mais c'est aussi par l'Europe que nous parviendrons à la consolider.\n\nDepuis 2017 et le discours de la Sorbonne du Président de la République, l'Europe a changé. Elle a surmonté les crises et pris ses responsabilités.\nC'est grâce à l'Europe, que nous avons pu avoir des vaccins face à l'épidémie.\nGrâce à l'Europe, que nous avons bénéficié d'un plan de relance massif.\nGrâce à l'Europe, que nous soutenons l'Ukraine depuis le premier jour de la guerre, face à l'agression russe.\nGrâce à l'Europe, que nous avons imposé des normes aux géants du numériques.\nGrâce à l'Europe, que nous avons instauré un impôt minimal sur les sociétés pour lutter contre l'optimisation fiscale.\nGrâce à l'Europe, que nous contrôlons mieux nos frontières, grâce au Pacte sur la migration et l'asile. Un pacte que je peux résumer en une phrase : nous contrôlons enfin qui peut entrer dans l'espace Schengen et qui ne le peut pas.\nGrâce à l'Europe, aussi, que nous investissons massivement dans des secteurs stratégiques et pour notre industrie.\n\nCeux qui prônent la fin de l'application des traités sont les partisans d'un Frexit déguisé, qui affaiblirait la France.\nMoins d'Europe, c'est moins de puissance pour la France.\nJe ne prendrai qu'un exemple : le Brexit !\nSes partisans promettaient des jours heureux à l'économie britannique et au peuple anglais. La semaine dernière, à cause du Brexit, les derniers hauts-fourneaux de Grande-Bretagne ont fermé et on ne produit plus d'acier au Royaume-Uni !\nNous, en France, au contraire, notamment grâce aux investissements de l'Europe, l'industrie revient !\n\nQui étaient les premiers soutiens du Brexit ?\nQui, a baptisé dans les villes qu'il dirige, des rues « Rue du Brexit » ?\nQui s'est affiché ouvertement avec le leader du camp du Brexit ?\nC'est le Rassemblement National !\nL'Europe. Eternel bouc émissaire de ceux qui, faute de pouvoir diriger un pays, veulent toujours détruire un continent. Pas un Français ne pense que nous\n\npouvons nous passer d'Europe. Pas un Français, non plus, ne pense que l'Europe a su pleinement trouver la place juste dans sa vie. Ils ont raison. Tout n'est pas parfait, et il reste des chantiers à mener.\nMais les faits sont là : avec l'Europe, notre puissance est démultipliée. Et ces dernières années, nous avons commencé à la changer.\n\nEt je le dis solennellement, à l'heure où il est minuit moins une dans le siècle, face aux impérialismes, les masques devront tomber. On peut vouloir changer l'Europe pour l'intérêt du pays, et nous le faisons. Mais on ne peut pas vouloir sortir de l'Europe, sauf à avoir d'autres intérêts, sauf à servir un autre pays, une autre puissance.\n\nMadame la Présidente,\nMesdames et Messieurs les députés,\n\nVoilà les grands principes qui guideront mon action, celle de mon Gouvernement, pour la France et pour les Français.\nPour notre France qui n'a jamais perdu son ambition de grandeur.\nPour ces Français qui n'ont jamais manqué à leurs devoirs.\nCes axes que je vous ai présentés, ils sont une réponse aux enjeux de la Nation.\nProbablement pas la seule. Mais le reflet de l'ambition que nous portons avec le Président de la République.\nIls correspondent aussi aux rêves qu'une génération avait appris à ne plus porter.\nTrouver un emploi stable.\nAcheter un logement.\nFonder une famille.\nFaire des sacrifices mais acceptables s'ils servent à l'ascension de leurs enfants.\nAimer les paysages, une culture commune, une société libre et tenue.\nDans une époque si difficile, il n'y a pas de réponse simple. Mais il y a des espoirs tranquilles à raviver.\n\nJ'assumerai toujours de débattre avec vous. Je respecterai toujours vos opinions, vos propositions.\nJe ne rejetterai jamais la critique, tant qu'elle est constructive.\nCes mots, je les adresse à vous, et je les adresse aux Français. Je sais leurs attentes, je sais qu'ils ne me pardonneront rien.\nLes temps sont troublés, les doutes sont nombreux, mais l'espoir est là.\n\nLa France est puissante.\nParce que ce qui nous réunit est toujours plus fort que ce qui nous divise.\nParce que la France, notre pays, notre Nation, notre terre, demeureront notre fierté.\nParce-que oui, être Français, en 2024, oui, c'est une fierté. Notre société est plus ouverte, plus audacieuse, plus pionnière que l'image que nous nous renvoyons parfois à nous-mêmes.\n\nÊtre Français en 2024, c'est vivre dans un pays où l'histoire s'écrit.\n\nÊtre Français en 2024, c'est vivre dans un pays qui n'a pas renoncé au progrès social, à protéger les droits de tous et surtout de toutes, et à en conquérir de nouveaux.\n\nÊtre Français en 2024, c'est vivre dans un pays dont l'honneur est de se battre pour la stabilité du monde, pour la justice et pour la paix.\nÊtre Français en 2024, c'est – dans un pays qui, il y a 10 ans seulement, se déchirait autour du mariage pour tous – pouvoir être Premier ministre en assumant son homosexualité.\n\nDe tout cela, je vois la preuve que notre pays bouge. La preuve que les mentalités évoluent. La preuve que nous n'avons aucune raison de céder à la fatalité.\nAlors, je n'ai qu'une chose à dire à nos concitoyens, quelle que soit leur couleur de peau, leur origine, leur adresse ou leurs croyances : la France est votre pays ; et, en France, tout est possible !\n\nMadame la Présidente,\nMesdames et messieurs les députés,\n\nOui, nous sommes fiers d'être français et, avec vous, je veux faire briller cette fierté française !\n\nJe viens de vous présenter le cap de mon Gouvernement.\nLe cap pris sous l'autorité du Président de la République, pour reprendre pleinement notre destin en main et restaurer notre souveraineté.\n\nEt aujourd'hui, nous sommes prêts.\nPrêts à voir la vérité en face.\n\nPrêts à écouter et prêts à entendre la voix de tous les Français.\nPrêts à agir.\n\nPrêts à œuvrer sans relâche, fidèles à notre devise républicaine.\nPrêts à garantir la Liberté.\nA œuvrer pour plus d'Egalité.\nA toujours choisir la Fraternité.\n\nParce que, Madame la Présidente, Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, nous ne sommes pas n'importe quel pays.\nNous ne serons jamais une puissance moyenne, qui se résignerait au déclin avec fatalité.\nNous ne sommes pas condamnés à subir, mais déterminés à agir.\nDéterminés à prendre notre destin en main.\nDéterminés, Madame la Présidente, Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, parce que sommes la France et que rien ne résiste au peuple français !\n\nJe vous remercie.\n\nSource https://www.gouvernement.fr, le 31 janvier 2024"

Manuel Bompard\n\n«Il faut que la voix des hommes sans voix empêche les puissants de dormir», disait l’abbé Pierre il y a soixante-dix ans._(«Oh!» sur plusieurs bancs du groupe RE.)_ C’est cette voix que j’entends faire résonner ici aujourd’hui. Monsieur le Premier ministre, tout le monde sait que vous n’êtes qu’un obligé. Le Président de la République a fixé votre cap. Il vous impose ses ministres; il court-circuite vos annonces; il s’impose même en conférence de presse à quelques minutes de votre discours de politique générale. Alors, allez dire à celui qui vous envoie que son règne n’a que trop duré _(Applaudissements sur les bancs du groupe LFI-NUPES. –⁠Exclamations sur plusieurs bancs du groupe RE),_ et qu’en vous censurant, notre intention est bien de le censurer lui, de vous censurer vous tous, cette «caste privilégiée à combattre», comme l’a dit, dans un rare moment de lucidité, votre ministre de l’école privée.\n\nM. Sylvain Maillard\n\nIls font dodo les révolutionnaires, vu le monde qu’il y a sur vos bancs!\n\nM. Manuel Bompard\n\nMonsieur le Premier ministre, vous avez eu, la semaine dernière, une heure vingt pour présenter votre discours de politique générale. Je n’ai aujourd’hui que dix minutes.\n\nMme Aurore Bergé, ministre déléguée chargée de l’égalité entre les femmes et les hommes et de la lutte contre les discriminations\n\nC’est déjà assez!\n\nM. Manuel Bompard\n\nCe sera insuffisant pour dresser la liste de toutes vos infamies. J’irai donc à l’essentiel. Il faut vous censurer pour protéger le peuple des souffrances que vous voulez lui infliger:…\n\nM. Jean-Louis Bourlanges\n\nOh là là!\n\nM. Manuel Bompard\n\n…augmentation de la facture d’électricité et de gaz, hausse du prix de l’alimentation, des péages d’autoroute et des mutuelles, doublement de la franchise médicale, réduction des allocations chômage, remise en cause du Smic, refus d’indexer les salaires sur l’inflation. Vous êtes le doux visage de la brutalité sociale. _(Applaudissements sur les bancs du groupe LFI-NUPES et sur quelques bancs du groupe GDR-NUPES.)_\n\nIl faut vous censurer pour faire régner l’intérêt général plutôt que l’entre-soi, cet entre-soi dont votre gouvernement est la parfaite illustration: celui du séparatisme scolaire, depuis l’École alsacienne jusqu’au collège Stanislas que vous gorgez d’argent public _(Applaudissements sur les bancs du groupe LFI-NUPES)_, celui de l’école à deux vitesses que vous voulez imposer à marche forcée, celui de Parcoursup que vous infligez aux autres mais pas à vos propres enfants _(Applaudissements sur les bancs du groupe LFI-NUPES. –⁠M.Philippe Brun applaudit également)_, celui des ghettos de riches, celui de l’impunité garantie pour les communes qui refusent de construire du logement social, auxquelles vous offrez sur un plateau le démantèlement de la loi SRU, la loi relative à la solidarité et au renouvellement urbains._(«Scandaleux!» sur plusieurs bancs du groupe LFI-NUPES.)_\n\nIl faut vous censurer pour rétablir l’égalité face à la loi, car tout le pays a compris, désormais, que nous voici revenus au temps du Roi-Soleil que nous racontait La Fontaine: que vous soyez dirigeant de la FNSEA –⁠la Fédération nationale des syndicats d’exploitants agricoles– ou syndicaliste ouvrier, PDG de la grande distribution ou agriculteur de la Confédération paysanne, que vous ayez un tracteur ou un gilet jaune, que vous veniez de Neuilly ou des quartiers populaires, les jugements de M.Darmanin vous rendront blanc ou noir. _(Applaudissements sur les bancs du groupe LFI-NUPES.)_\n\nM. Gérald Darmanin, ministre de l’intérieur et des outre-mer\n\nC’est bien de citer les grands auteurs!\n\nM. Manuel Bompard\n\nEn agissant ainsi, c’est l’autorité de l’État que vous affaiblissez; c’est la force de la loi que vous détruisez.\n\nIl faut vous censurer pour protéger la France de votre addiction au libre-échange. Notre agriculture meurt de la concurrence déloyale, les pires produits du reste du monde envahissent nos marchés, mais vous continuez de sacrifier notre souveraineté alimentaire.\n\nMme Caroline Abadie\n\nIls s’y connaissent en agriculture!\n\nM. Manuel Bompard\n\nHier, vous ratifiiez un accord avec la Nouvelle-Zélande. La semaine dernière, au Parlement européen, vos députés votaient en faveur de nouveaux accords de libre-échange avec le Chili et le Kenya. _(Applaudissements sur les bancs du groupe LFI-NUPES.)_ Aujourd’hui, vous faites mine de rejeter l’accord avec le Marché commun du Sud –⁠le Mercosur–, mais les négociations se poursuivent en coulisses, comme l’a confirmé la semaine dernière la Commission européenne. Pour qui nous prenez-vous? _(Mêmes mouvements.)_ Incapable de rompre avec cette idéologie mortifère, vous sacrifiez notre santé et la biodiversité. Les agriculteurs ne vivent pas de leur travail? Ce sera double ration de pesticides. Au revoir les abeilles, et bonjour les cancers! _(Mêmes mouvements.)_\n\nM. Fabrice Brun\n\nQuelle caricature!\n\nMme Sylvie Retailleau, ministre de l’enseignement supérieur et de la recherche\n\nTout en nuance!\n\nM. Manuel Bompard\n\nTant pis pour votre fameux «réarmement démographique» –⁠quel concept insupportable!\n\nIl faut vous censurer pour retirer le pouvoir des mains de l’oligarchie qui vous commande: ces multinationales dont vous refusez d’encadrer les marges, abandonnant les producteurs comme les consommateurs; ces grands actionnaires du CAC40 qui ont reçu encore, cette année, un record historique de dividendes, près de 100 milliards; ces superprofiteurs que vous protégez servilement alors que le peuple a froid, a faim et dort dans la rue. _(Applaudissements sur les bancs du groupe LFI-NUPES.)_\n\nIl faut vous censurer pour protéger la République de votre mariage hideux avec l’extrême droite, car vous êtes prêt à tout pour diviser le peuple, comme le vote de la loi «immigration» l’a montré –⁠même à reprendre les pires propositions racistes et xénophobes et à jeter en pâture la figure de l’immigré ou du musulman. _(Applaudissements sur les bancs du groupe LFI-NUPES.)_\n\nMme Caroline Abadie\n\nVous avez la mémoire courte!\n\nM. Manuel Bompard\n\nEt quand la cruelle réalité vous éclate au visage, vous transformez le Conseil constitutionnel en camion poubelle de vos délires réactionnaires. _(Applaudissements sur les bancs du groupe LFI-NUPES.)_ Vous rendez-vous compte du mal que vous faites à la France?\n\nM. Sylvain Maillard\n\nJe comprends pourquoi les vôtres ne sont pas sortis de leur lit!\n\nM. Manuel Bompard\n\nIl faut vous censurer pour rétablir la voix de la France dans le monde –⁠une France non alignée et indépendante; une France qui nous rend fiers sur la scène internationale, une France qui dit «cessez-le-feu» quand les tribunaux internationaux pointent un risque de génocide à Gaza _(Applaudissements sur les bancs du groupe LFI-NUPES),_ une France qui fait quelque chose quand elle occupe, comme c’était le cas le mois dernier, la présidence du Conseil de sécurité des Nations unies;…\n\nMme Constance Le Grip\n\nQuelle honte!\n\nM. Manuel Bompard\n\n…une France qui n’a pas de double standard, qui ne hiérarchise pas entre les victimes, qui soutient les décisions de la Cour internationale de justice de la même manière quand elles concernent les peuples ukrainien ou palestinien.\n\nMonsieur le Premier ministre, la semaine dernière, vous avez appelé à revenir à des principes clairs. Je vous cite: «Tu casses, tu répares; tu salis, tu nettoies; tu défies l’autorité, on t’apprend à la respecter». _(«Bravo!» et applaudissements sur les bancs du groupe RE.)_\n\nM. Emmanuel Pellerin\n\nÇa, ça ne vous plaît pas!\n\nM. Robin Reda\n\nVous avez pas mal de choses à réparer!\n\nM. Manuel Bompard\n\nJe vous prends donc au mot: «Tu casses l’État, tu t’en vas; tu salis la République, tu pars avec ta clique; tu défies le Parlement, le Parlement t’apprend à le respecter.» _(Applaudissements sur les bancs du groupe LFI-NUPES. –⁠Exclamations sur les bancs du groupe RE.)_\n\nMardi dernier, vous nous avez rappelé que vous étiez né en 1989, année du bicentenaire de la Révolution française.\n\nMme Michèle Peyron\n\nC’est une belle année! L’année de naissance de ma fille!_(Sourires.)_\n\nM. Manuel Bompard\n\nPour conclure, je ferai donc miens les mots de Saint-Just: «Peuple, si le roi est jamais absous, souviens-toi que nous ne serons plus dignes de ta confiance, et tu pourras nous accuser de perfidie.»\n\nMme Constance Le Grip\n\nAh, il nous manquait, Saint-Just!\n\nM. Manuel Bompard\n\nAlors, chers collègues, soyons dignes de la confiance du peuple: censurons le Gouvernement! _(Mmes et MM.les députés des groupes LFI-NUPES et Écolo-NUPES se lèvent et applaudissent. –⁠Plusieurs députés du groupe GDR-NUPES applaudissent aussi.)_\n\nMme la présidente\n\nLa parole est à M.le Premier ministre.\n\nM. Jérôme Guedj\n\nSéance de rattrapage pour annoncer la loi sur le grand âge!\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\nLa semaine dernière, un nouveau record a été battu –⁠un record qui rend visiblement fiers ses auteurs, mais un record qui, je crois, ne rend pas tout à fait honneur à notre débat public et démocratique. _(Exclamations sur les bancs du groupe LFI-NUPES.)_ Ce record, c’est un record de vitesse de dépôt d’une motion de censure. _(«Eh oui!»_ _sur plusieurs bancs du groupe RE.)_ Pour ma prédécesseure, à qui je veux rendre hommage, et qui a surmonté trente et une motions de censure en vingt mois,…\n\nM. Alexis Corbière\n\nPour vingt-trois 49.3!\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\n…vous aviez attendu l’issue de sa déclaration de politique générale; cette fois-ci, même pas. Je n’avais même pas encore livré mes orientations ici, dans l’hémicycle, à l’occasion de ma déclaration de politique générale, que déjà, vous aviez déposé votre texte, comme si les annonces ne vous intéressaient pas _(Exclamations sur les bancs des groupes LFI-NUPES et SOC)_;…\n\nM. Jean-Louis Bourlanges\n\nLaissez-nous écouter le Premier ministre, enfin!\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\n…comme si les actes vous importaient encore moins; comme si tout ce qui comptait, c’était le petit coup politique, la recherche de l’instabilité ou encore la promesse de l’obstruction.\n\nM. Sylvain Maillard\n\nEh oui!\n\nM. Boris Vallaud\n\nÇa nous fait plaisir de vous voir!\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\nIl y a des choses qui ne changent pas, en revanche: vous continuez à nous donner des leçons de démocratie interne, alors même que vous obéissez comme avec une télécommande à votre chef, Jean-Luc Mélenchon; dès qu’il tweete, vous suivez ses orientations et ses commandes.\n\nM. Sylvain Maillard\n\nQu’est-ce qu’il a dit, Jean-Luc?\n\nM. Alexis Corbière\n\nIl fait ton portrait!\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\nEn nous élisant en 2022, les Français ont pourtant envoyé un message très clair.\n\nM. Nicolas Sansu\n\nC’est clair-obscur!\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\nPlutôt que de vous réclamer du peuple, écoutez-le. Écoutez les Français: ils vous diront qu’ils attendent des diagnostics clairs et des actes forts; ils vous diront qu’ils en ont assez des postures permanentes et des oppositions de principe; ils vous confirmeront que s’ils ont élu une Assemblée nationale avec une majorité claire, mais pas de majorité absolue, c’est parce qu’ils attendent de chacun de nous le dialogue, l’écoute et la construction. Que leur répondez-vous? Une motion de censure préventive, comme un pied de nez à toute volonté de dialogue. Votre déclaration de politique générale, elle est là: c’est le blocage permanent.\n\nMme Anna Pic\n\nC’est faux!\n\nMme Mathilde Panot\n\nAugmentez les salaires!\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\nNos compatriotes demandent des actes pour que le travail paie mieux, et toujours plus que l’inactivité. Notre réponse: déverrouiller, désmicardiser, débureaucratiser. Votre réponse: le blocage. Nos compatriotes demandent des services publics qui fonctionnent mieux. Notre réponse: plus de médecins, plus de moyens pour l’école. Votre réponse: le blocage. Nos compatriotes demandent le respect de l’autorité partout sur le territoire. Notre réponse: responsabiliser les parents, renforcer la lutte contre la drogue, une justice plus efficace. Votre réponse: le blocage. Nos compatriotes exigent une action résolue contre le dérèglement climatique. Notre réponse: la planification écologique, continuer l’accélération de la baisse de nos émissions, trouver des solutions pour chacun. Votre réponse: le blocage. Le blocage, encore le blocage, toujours et tout le temps le blocage, c’est votre seul cap et c’est votre seule promesse envers les Français. _(Exclamations sur les bancs du groupe LFI-NUPES.)_\n\nM. Alexis Corbière\n\nVous devriez avoir honte, monsieur Attal!\n\nMme Constance Le Grip\n\nVous n’avez aucune leçon de morale à nous donner!\n\nM. Alexis Corbière\n\nÇa fait sept ans que vous êtes là!\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\nMesdames et messieurs les députés de La France insoumise, vous osez nous accuser de conservatisme. _(«Oui! sur les bancs du groupe LFI-NUPES.)_\n\nMme Sophia Chikirou\n\nD’inaction, même!\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\nVenant de vous, cela ne manque pas d’audace! À chacune de vos attaques personnelles, à chacun de vos procès d’intention, vous nous replongez dans le XIX e siècle. À chacun de vos appels au matraquage fiscal, à la création de nouvelles contraintes, de nouvelles règles et de nouvelles taxes, vous nous replongez dans le mythe collectiviste où toute initiative est bridée, étouffée. À chacune de vos attaques contre l’Europe, vous nous replongez soixante-quinze ans en arrière, quand notre continent naviguait dans l’incertitude.\n\nM. Alexis Corbière\n\nVos arguments sont minables!\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\nAu fond, votre monde, c’est un monde où il n’y a pas besoin d’Union européenne (UE); c’est un monde où il faut tout taxer tout le temps et tout collectiviser, c’est un monde où l’économie n’a pas le droit de parler de climat. _(Applaudissements sur les bancs des groupes RE et Dem.)_ Le temps passe, le monde change, mais vos propositions et vos postures restent: il n’y a pas plus conservateurs que vous dans le paysage politique. _(Mêmes mouvements.)_\n\nM. Sylvain Maillard\n\nExactement!\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\nAvec mon gouvernement, nous n’avons pas renoncé à la conquête de nouvelles libertés et de nouveaux droits. Moi, je suis fier de vouloir adapter le travail aux nouvelles attentes des salariés. _(Protestations sur les bancs du groupe LFI-NUPES. –⁠Exclamations sur les bancs du groupe GDR-NUPES.)_ Moi, je suis fier de continuer à lutter contre les rentes et de faire de l’émancipation un des caps de notre action.\n\nJe suis fier de mener une transition écologique ambitieuse, qui prépare une société où l’on vit mieux, et pas une société de la régression, qui pénaliserait d’abord les classes moyennes et les plus fragiles.\n\nJe suis fier, grâce au compte épargne-temps (CET) universel, de permettre à chacun d’organiser sa vie comme il l’entend, de travailler plus quand il le souhaite et moins quand il fonde une famille ou doit s’occuper d’un proche.\n\nMme Sarah Legrain\n\nLa retraite à 64 ans!\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\nJe suis fier de me battre pour les droits des femmes et de vouloir inscrire la liberté de recourir à l’interruption volontaire de grossesse (IVG) dans la Constitution. _(Applaudissements sur les bancs du groupe RE.)_\n\nMme Sarah Legrain\n\nMais bien sûr!\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\nJe suis fier de lutter pour de nouveaux droits, notamment celui de mourir dans la dignité. _(Exclamations sur plusieurs bancs du groupe LFI-NUPES.)_\n\nCette majorité et ce gouvernement incarnent le progrès, la conquête de nouveaux droits et l’émancipation de chacun!\n\nM. Fabrice Brun\n\nBattez-vous aussi pour l’égalité d’accès aux droits!\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\nDepuis 2017, sous l’autorité du Président de la République, voilà ce qui nous anime et ce qui continuera de nous animer.\n\nM. Pierre Dharréville\n\nDétournement de mots!\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\nMesdames et messieurs les députés, vous me connaissez. En 2017, j’ai eu l’honneur d’être élu député et de siéger sur vos bancs. J’ai été membre du Gouvernement et j’ai travaillé avec vous. Alors, vous le savez, malgré les tentatives de certains, je ne me laisserai jamais intimider par les motions de censure préventives et par les cris. Je ne me laisserai jamais déstabiliser par les hurlements et par les injures.\n\nM. Pierre Dharréville\n\nNous non plus!\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\nRien ne me détournera du cap du dialogue et des solutions.\n\nDevant vous, je veux prendre trois engagements. Tout d’abord, je m’engage à garder toujours ma porte ouverte pour la discussion et la recherche d’accords.\n\nM. Jérôme Guedj\n\nChiche!\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\nDepuis 2022, à déjà plus de cinquante reprises, nous avons prouvé qu’il était possible de dépasser les clivages au service des Français…\n\nM. Paul Vannier\n\nAvec les lepénistes!\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\n…et que cette législature ne serait pas celle de l’immobilisme. Avec mon gouvernement, nous voulons agir aux côtés de tous les parlementaires.\n\nM. Pierre Dharréville\n\nSurtout ceux de droite!\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\nPour chaque texte, nous rechercherons des majorités dans le respect des convictions de chacun. Je l’ai montré lors des dialogues de Bercy et comme ministre de l’éducation nationale: je suis prêt à échanger avec chacun, sans _a priori_ ni arrière-pensée. _(Exclamations sur quelques bancs du groupe LFI-NUPES.)_ Je crois que l’avenir de la France vaut plus que les querelles partisanes. Je serai donc toujours à l’écoute…\n\nM. Paul Vannier\n\nDe Marine Le Pen!\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\n…et je répondrai toujours présent pour bâtir des solutions communes.\n\nM. Jean-François Coulomme\n\nLe 49.3, c’est le dialogue?\n\nM. Alexis Corbière\n\nEt le 49.3?\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\nMais vous, mesdames et messieurs les partisans de la censure, serez-vous au rendez-vous du dialogue? Avoir des convictions, ce n’est pas refuser la construction. Avec mon gouvernement, avec la majorité, nous sommes prêts au dialogue. Nous le voulons et notre porte sera toujours ouverte!\n\nM. Alexis Corbière\n\nCe n’est pas vrai!\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\nEnsuite, je m’engage à toujours respecter le Parlement et le débat d’idées. _(Mêmes mouvements.)_ Dans cet hémicycle, la République s’est forgée, nous avons conquis des droits et acquis des libertés. Dans cet hémicycle, résonnent encore les mots des grands débats qui ont fondé notre pays. Je ne me résous pas à ce qu’y résonnent désormais en permanence le vacarme et le brouhaha.\n\nM. Alexis Corbière\n\nVous connaissez l’histoire du Parlement, vous?\n\nMme Sarah Legrain\n\nLaissez le Parlement voter!\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\nRespecter le Parlement, c’est d’abord respecter les orateurs, tous les orateurs. _(Applaudissements sur les bancs des groupes RE, Dem et HOR.)_\n\nMme Sarah Legrain\n\nUn peu moins de 49.3!\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\nChacun ici est légitime, chacun a le droit de s’exprimer et d’être entendu._(Protestations sur les bancs du groupe LFI-NUPES.)_ Collectivement, nous avons un rôle à tenir, car si l’on ne s’écoute pas au Parlement,…\n\nM. Alexis Corbière\n\nC’est scandaleux!\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\n…si la violence verbale se banalise, comment pourrait-on prétendre à l’apaisement et au respect dans la société? Avec la majorité, avec mon gouvernement, nous veillerons toujours au respect de chacun, à la bonne tenue des débats, à ce que le travail parlementaire soit à la hauteur de ce que les Français attendent. Nous nous sommes engagés, dès 2017, à défendre la bienveillance.\n\nMme Sarah Legrain\n\nDe la bienveillance? Vraiment?\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\nMalgré vos tentatives, vous ne nous conduirez jamais à nous livrer, comme vous, à l’invective permanente, aux cris et aux hurlements. _(Applaudissements sur les bancs des groupes RE et Dem. –⁠Protestations sur quelques bancs du groupe LFI-NUPES.)_\n\nMme Estelle Folest\n\nBravo!\n\nM. Alexis Corbière\n\nQue c’est mauvais!\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\nEt vous, mesdames et messieurs les partisans de la censure, serez-vous au rendez-vous?\n\nMme Mathilde Panot\n\nVous êtes malade, de faire la morale au Parlement!\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\nRenoncerez-vous à faire de l’outrance un titre de gloire? Accepterez-vous de proposer des solutions et d’en débattre dans le respect des convictions de chacun? Accepterez-vous de confronter les idées plutôt que de multiplier les excès et les hurlements? _(Exclamations sur plusieurs bancs du groupe LFI-NUPES.)_\n\nM. Hadrien Clouet\n\nDonc pas de 49.3?\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\nEnfin, mesdames et messieurs les députés, je prends l’engagement de toujours respecter nos institutions et de toujours défendre nos principes démocratiques, cela va de soi –⁠cette exigence est au cœur de notre action depuis 2017! _(Mêmes mouvements.)_\n\nM. Pierre Dharréville\n\nQuelle autodérision!\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\nVous répétez sans cesse que nous n’avons pas de majorité absolue. Ce n’est ni un secret, ni une nouveauté. Cette situation est rare, mais elle n’est pas inédite sous la V e République. Elle a toujours soulevé des débats, mais notre Constitution solide, approuvée par le peuple français, a permis de la surmonter sans jamais mettre notre démocratie en danger. Cette situation n’a pas empêché des réformes majeures comme la création des centres hospitaliers universitaires (CHU) ou, trente ans plus tard, celle du revenu minimum d’insertion (RMI).\n\nMme Sarah Legrain\n\nEt les retraites!\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\nElle ne nous empêche pas et ne nous empêchera pas d’avancer au service de nos concitoyens. _(Exclamations sur quelques bancs du groupe LFI-NUPES.)_\n\nVous demandiez un vote, vous l’aurez dans quelques minutes. Mais en accepterez-vous le résultat?\n\nM. Sylvain Maillard\n\nEh non!\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\nJe m’interroge, car, deux ans après, certains crient encore à l’usurpation de majorité et refusent d’accepter leur défaite aux élections présidentielle et législatives. _(Applaudissements sur les bancs du groupe RE. –⁠Exclamations sur plusieurs bancs du groupe LFI-NUPES.)_ La réalité, c’est que les Français nous ont confié un mandat démocratique pour gouverner et trouver des majorités texte par texte. Ce mandat, avec mon gouvernement, nous allons le remplir, le respecter.\n\nPour les énergies renouvelables, pour le partage de la valeur dans l’entreprise, pour les moyens de la justice et des armées, pour le nucléaire, pour les agriculteurs, pour un système de santé et un accès aux soins renforcés,…\n\nM. Paul Vannier\n\nPour l’école privée!\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\n…et, la semaine dernière, pour inscrire la liberté de recourir à l’interruption volontaire de grossesse dans la Constitution, nous avons été capables de trouver des solutions qui ont rallié des voix au-delà des clivages, y compris sur les bancs de la gauche. Je n’ai aucun doute que nous y parviendrons encore. Avec mon gouvernement, je ne renoncerai jamais. _(Exclamations sur quelques bancs du groupe LFI-NUPES.)_\n\nMesdames et messieurs les députés, je crois au débat et à la recherche d’accords.\n\nM. Manuel Bompard\n\nAvec les bancs de l’extrême droite!\n\nMme Michèle Peyron\n\nArrêtez de faire de la pub à Marine Le Pen!\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\nJe crois au respect des orateurs comme des idées. Je crois aussi à l’action, à la détermination et aux résultats, dans l’intérêt des Français.\n\nM. Alexis Corbière\n\nAucune originalité!\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\nAvant même que j’aie prononcé ma déclaration de politique générale, vous avez tenté de censurer mon gouvernement. _(Mêmes mouvements.)_ Cela ne m’arrêtera ni dans ma volonté d’agir, ni dans ma volonté de dialoguer. J’ai entendu l’appel des Français. Avec le Gouvernement, je suis déterminé à répondre à leurs attentes, à leurs inquiétudes, à leurs doutes et à leurs colères. _(Applaudissements sur les bancs des groupes RE, Dem et HOR.)_ Avec mon gouvernement, je mettrai toutes mes forces dans la bataille pour convaincre et construire des majorités, car il y va de l’avenir de la France et des Français! _(Les députés du groupe RE se lèvent et applaudissent. –⁠Applaudissements sur les bancs des groupes Dem, dont certains députés se lèvent, et HOR.)_\n\nM. Alexis Corbière\n\nC’était assez faible!\n\nMme Nadia Hai\n\nTu n’as rien écouté!\n\nMme la présidente\n\nLa parole est à Mme Aude Luquet.\n\nMme Aude Luquet\n\nChers collègues de la NUPES, vous aurez patienté presque un mois avant de déposer votre première motion de censure de l’année.\n\nMme Estelle Folest\n\nC’est un exploit!\n\nMme Aude Luquet\n\nJe m’interroge encore sur les raisons de cette motion. Certes, le Gouvernement n’a pas demandé de vote de confiance à l’Assemblée, mais il n’est pas nécessaire d’être Premier ministre pour savoir compter. Depuis 2022, nous n’avons plus la majorité absolue, mais il faut bien faire avancer le pays. C’est ce que font le Gouvernement et la majorité relative. Nous avançons malgré vous!\n\nNous avons réformé le marché du travail pour favoriser le retour au plein emploi, rétabli l’équilibre du régime de retraites pour assurer son fonctionnement au cours des prochaines décennies, amélioré la politique environnementale et énergétique de la France, donné des moyens d’action à notre armée, notre police et nos hôpitaux, facilité le retour des usines dans les territoires, engagé un plan contre les fraudes fiscales et sociales, augmenté nos enseignants et apporté des réponses aux agriculteurs. Tout n’est pas parfait.\n\nMme Ségolène Amiot\n\nÇa c’est clair!\n\nMme Aude Luquet\n\nMais le groupe Démocrate reste convaincu que les débats de cet hémicycle peuvent être constructifs et aboutir à des consensus bénéfiques pour les Français. Nous ne pensons pas tous la même chose, à l’image de nos concitoyens –⁠c’est d’ailleurs ce qui fait notre richesse–, mais ce n’est pas parce que nous pensons différemment que nous devons nous opposer de manière stérile dans une piètre _comedia dell’arte_.\n\nNous avons la responsabilité collective d’échanger nos idées et nos arguments pour trouver les meilleures solutions possibles pour le pays, ou en tout cas de tout faire pour y parvenir. Certains textes sur lesquels nous étions sceptiques à l’origine ont abouti: avant Noël, mon groupe a insisté pour inscrire à l’ordre du jour de l’Assemblée la proposition de loi encadrant l’intervention des cabinets de conseil privés dans les politiques publiques, rédigée par les groupes d’opposition du Sénat.\n\nM. Benjamin Lucas\n\nUn texte vidé de sa substance!\n\nMme Aude Luquet\n\nBien qu’en désaccord avec la version initiale de la proposition de loi, nous avons estimé que le débat devait avoir lieu.\n\nM. Benjamin Lucas\n\nMerci, mes seigneurs!\n\nMme Aude Luquet\n\nRésultat, l’examen du texte en séance la semaine dernière, sous la conduite d’un rapporteur communiste et d’un rapporteur démocrate, a permis d’avancer, certes imparfaitement, mais la navette fera son œuvre. Oui, nous pouvons, et nous devons, discuter de tout, même quand le texte vient d’un camp qui n’est pas le nôtre.\n\nMme Sandrine Rousseau\n\nÇa s’appelle le Parlement!\n\nMme Aude Luquet\n\nVisiblement, vous pensez exactement le contraire. Toute construction commune est vouée à l’échec quand la proposition ne vient pas de vous. Pourtant, comme le disait notre président de groupe la semaine dernière, nous aurons beaucoup à faire, au cours des trois prochaines années, pour redonner sa force à la France, pour redonner aux Français l’envie d’être unis et solidaires, et pour leur redonner confiance dans leur avenir et celui de leurs enfants.\n\nM. Alexis Corbière\n\nIl disait aussi que Gabriel Attal lui rappelait Valéry Giscard d’Estaing!\n\nMme Aude Luquet\n\nNous avons une chance inouïe de vivre en France, le pays des solidarités à chaque étape de la vie, le pays dans lequel chacun peut être soigné et a accès à une éducation gratuite de qualité.\n\nM. Hadrien Clouet\n\nCe n’est pas gratuit, Stanislas!\n\nMme Aude Luquet\n\nMais nous devons nous adapter en permanence à ce monde qui évolue: les solutions de 1997, de 2007, voire, dans certains cas, de 2017, ne sont pas, ou plus forcément, celles dont nous avons besoin aujourd’hui.\n\nLoin des basses querelles politiciennes, les Français attendent que nous redonnions à l’école les moyens de préparer correctement les nouvelles générations, parce qu’elles sont notre avenir, celui de notre pays. Poursuivons le travail pour que l’école redevienne celle de la promesse républicaine, de l’émancipation et de l’ascenseur social.\n\nVous l’avez dit la semaine dernière, monsieur le Premier ministre, il faut revoir le système de formation des professeurs et leur redonner confiance pour qu’ils aient envie d’enseigner, qu’ils y trouvent leur compte –⁠pas uniquement sur le plan financier– et que l’école attire de nouveau des talents. Pour cela, il faut aussi penser autrement le système: être davantage à l’écoute de ce qui fonctionne, ouvrir à tous la possibilité d’explorer de nouvelles pistes d’enseignement, s’adapter au temps nouveau.\n\nLes Français nous attendent aussi pour adapter le système de santé. Depuis six ans, les efforts financiers, humains et technologiques n’ont pas manqué. Je pense notamment à la suppression du numerus clausus –⁠trois ou quatre générations de ministres et de députés auraient dû prendre cette mesure avant nous. Nous en sommes convaincus, investir dans cette jeunesse qui rêve de soigner est un investissement d’avenir, même s’il exige des moyens importants. Nous ne devons pas compter sur les autres pays, confrontés aux mêmes difficultés que nous, pour compenser des décennies d’égarement. Il y aurait bien d’autres points à développer sur le sujet de la santé, mais des textes nous donneront bientôt l’occasion d’en débattre, j’en suis certaine, monsieur le Premier ministre.\n\nNous devons aussi conforter notre pays sur le plan écologique. Le combat pour le climat et l’environnement a beau être mondial, nous devons poursuivre au niveau national ce que nous avons engagé il y a six ans, parce que les résultats sont là. C’est l’un des domaines dans lesquels nous avons le plus avancé, ce que démontrent les chiffres trimestre après trimestre: au cours des six premiers mois de l’année 2023, les émissions de gaz à effet de serre ont enregistré une baisse de plus de 4% par rapport à 2022, nous rapprochant de plus en plus des objectifs ambitieux que nous nous sommes fixés.\n\nS’agissant de la grave crise de l’immobilier que nous traversons, rappelons que le budget consacré au logement est colossal en France –⁠40 milliards d’euros– et bien supérieur à celui de nos voisins européens. Le groupe Démocrate appelle à une remise à plat du système à partir d’une revue de l’ensemble des sujets liés à l’immobilier: le financement, le foncier, les économies d’énergie, l’objectif zéro artificialisation nette (ZAN), la transformation des bureaux et des bâtiments vides en logements, la fiscalité, les allocations. _(Exclamations sur quelques bancs du groupe LFI-NUPES.)_\n\nEn ce qui concerne l’emploi, nous avons réussi à atteindre le taux de chômage le plus bas depuis quarante ans grâce aux réformes lancées en 2017, ce dont nous nous réjouissons. Néanmoins, nous ne pouvons pas nous résoudre à ce que plus de 7% de la population active y soit condamnée. Certains retrouveront un emploi rapidement ou lanceront leur propre activité, mais d’autres sont au chômage depuis longtemps et courent le risque de s’y enfermer. Pour ceux-là, notre volonté est double: il faut simplifier les règles d’employabilité et d’assurance chômage pour atténuer les craintes de potentiels employeurs, tout en continuant à les former davantage pour leur permettre de trouver demain un emploi qui leur correspondra.\n\nLa formation ne sert pas qu’à prévenir le chômage de longue durée; elle est aussi un enjeu de pouvoir d’achat. Le reste à vivre de ceux qui travaillent est souvent insuffisant au regard des efforts engagés. Notre objectif est simple: il faut faire en sorte que le travail paie mieux, d’où le nécessaire inventaire des prélèvements sur le travail, mais pas seulement! Nous devons aussi continuer de développer notre économie, pour assurer la richesse de demain. Je l’ai dit tout à l’heure, notre richesse repose sur un système solidaire qui ne laisse personne au bord de la route, et qui doit s’exercer tout particulièrement au bénéfice des familles et des enfants.\n\nNous ne sommes pas suffisamment ambitieux en matière de politique familiale. En effet, les congés parentaux ne sont pas toujours adaptés. Ils sont trop longs pour certains, en particulier pour certaines, qui s’éloignent de l’emploi et subissent les conséquences dramatiques de cet éloignement dans leur carrière; trop courts pour d’autres, qui ne partagent pas suffisamment les bouleversements liés à l’arrivée d’un enfant avec leur conjoint. Les modes de garde doivent également être développés en laissant la liberté aux parents de s’organiser comme ils l’entendent.\n\nDe même, l’accompagnement financier de la société doit être revu et élargi à l’ensemble des familles. Une attention particulière en matière de revenu, de logement et d’alimentation doit être apportée aux familles monoparentales, aujourd’hui les plus concernées par la précarité. Ces femmes –⁠car ce sont principalement des femmes– et ces enfants ont besoin que nous nous engagions davantage en leur faveur. J’espère, monsieur le Premier ministre, que votre gouvernement proposera prochainement des mesures spécifiques à leur intention.\n\nEnfin, tout cela ne sera possible qu’avec des finances publiques saines. La capacité de réformer dépend avant tout de la crédibilité de l’État, notamment de ses finances publiques. Ainsi, nous ne pourrons répondre efficacement à l’enjeu de la dette climatique sans nous attaquer à celui de la dette publique tant l’investissement environnemental est important. Pour le groupe Démocrate, la dette n’est pas forcément une mauvaise chose si elle est productive à long terme. La dette inutile d’aujourd’hui, celle que nous laissons filer pour nos dépenses quotidiennes de fonctionnement, est la dette que nous ne pourrons pas lever demain pour financer les investissements nécessaires.\n\nVoilà, en quelques mots, mesdames et messieurs de l’opposition, tout ce sur quoi nous pourrions travailler ensemble si vous acceptiez le principe du débat démocratique avant de penser à vous opposer. Votre posture est telle qu’avant même que ce nouveau gouvernement commence à travailler, vous voulez le sanctionner. _(Exclamations sur quelques bancs du groupe LFI-NUPES.)_ Si vous aviez la capacité, en vous alliant à d’autres, de constituer une majorité alternative, cela se comprendrait mais, de la même façon qu’un Premier ministre sait compter, je sais aussi le faire: vous n’en avez pas les moyens et, une fois encore, votre démarche est vaine.\n\nMonsieur le Premier ministre, vous le savez, vous pouvez compter sur le groupe Démocrate pour travailler avec vous et pour vous soutenir dans votre volonté de réformer le pays avec énergie. Nous serons à vos côtés avec nos espoirs, nos valeurs et notre combativité. Nous ne voterons pas la motion de censure. _(Applaudissements sur les bancs des groupes Dem et RE. –⁠Exclamations sur quelques bancs du groupe LFI-NUPES.)_\n\nMme la présidente\n\nLa parole est à M.Boris Vallaud.\n\nM. Boris Vallaud\n\nMonsieur le Premier ministre, il ne vous aura pas fallu attendre longtemps pour avoir un mauvais bilan. Cette semaine, vous avez renoncé au plan Écophyto, sacrifié l’avenir au présent, opposé la question environnementale à la question agricole. Bal tragique à Matignon, deux morts: l’agriculture et la santé. _(Applaudissements sur les bancs du groupe SOC. –⁠Mme Cyrielle Chatelain applaudit également.)_ Vous n’êtes pas un visionnaire, vous êtes un démagogue.\n\nCette semaine, à l’occasion du soixante-dixième anniversaire de l’appel de l’Abbé Pierre, vous avez réussi le tour de force de saper la loi SRU, notamment l’objectif de mixité sociale dans l’habitat, déjà lourdement fragilisé.\n\nM. Erwan Balanant\n\nN’importe quoi!\n\nM. Boris Vallaud\n\nVous qui avez parlé de réarmement civique, vous donnez une prime à la canaille à celles et ceux qui ne respectent pas la loi depuis des années. Cette semaine, vous avez augmenté de près de 10% le tarif de l’électricité, alors que la Commission de régulation de l’énergie recommandait de le baisser, ce qui alourdira de 153 euros en moyenne la facture d’un couple qui vit dans 50 m 2. Vous voulez, non pas que le travail paie pour vivre, mais qu’il paie vos factures.\n\nMme Nadia Hai\n\nÇa ne se passe pas bien au PS en ce moment!\n\nM. Boris Vallaud\n\nCette semaine encore, vous avez mis les enseignants dans la rue et réussi à faire démissionner le recteur de l’académie de Paris, enterrant avec lui une réforme visant à introduire plus de mixité sociale dans les classes préparatoires. Vous n’êtes pas le Premier ministre des classes moyennes, mais celui des classes affaires.\n\nM. Erwan Balanant\n\nRegardez les chiffres de la mixité à Paris!\n\nM. Boris Vallaud\n\nCette semaine, vous avez réussi à pénaliser encore davantage les travailleurs seniors, en annonçant la suppression de l’allocation de solidarité spécifique.\n\nLes personnes très vulnérables seront les victimes de vos choix budgétaires, dont vous ferez porter le poids aux départements.\n\nVous venez d’arriver et, pourtant, il est déjà temps de partir, car nous savons que vous ne nettoierez pas ce que vous aurez sali, que vous ne réparerez pas ce que vous aurez cassé. Cependant, attaché à la vérité autant que vous l’êtes, je veux reconnaître que vous avez tenu parole lorsque vous promettiez de supprimer tous les organes qui ne se seraient pas réunis ces douze derniers mois: vous avez définitivement dissous votre hémisphère gauche. _(M.Jérôme Guedj sourit.)_\n\nM. Alexis Corbière\n\nAïe!\n\nM. Boris Vallaud\n\nMonsieur le Premier ministre, comme Bruno Le Maire semble-t-il, qui n’est jamais avare d’un mensonge ou d’une approximation, vous êtes né en 1989. Cela ne vous empêche pas de regarder l’avenir avec de vieilles lunettes.\n\nM. Benjamin Lucas\n\nExactement!\n\nM. Boris Vallaud\n\nVos réformes du marché du travail, du RSA et de l’assurance chômage, faites de mauvaises idées et de mauvais coups, sont de véritables fabriques à travailleurs pauvres. Elles ont 40 ans, sont plus vieilles que vous et sentent la naphtaline.\n\nVotre priorité est claire: favoriser le travail, afin qu’il paie davantage que l’inactivité. Vous voulez «désmicardiser» la France, alors que, depuis 2017, vous avez continûment refusé les coups de pouce ainsi que le lancement d’une réforme visant à indexer le Smic sur l’inflation que vous trouvez trop généreuse. Nous ne savons plus si votre projet est d’augmenter les salaires ou de freiner la hausse du Smic.\n\nMonsieur le Premier ministre, nous voulons que le travail paie et qu’il paie bien. Pour cela, nous souhaitons que la valeur change de camp, qu’elle ne soit plus du côté du capital, des rentiers, des héritiers, des actionnaires et des rémunérations extravagantes, de ceux auxquels vous avez consenti tous les cadeaux et réservé tous les privilèges depuis 2017 –⁠ces professionnels du séparatisme social–,…\n\nM. Jean-François Coulomme\n\nCe sont leurs obligés!\n\nM. Boris Vallaud\n\n…mais du côté du travail, des travailleurs, des classes populaires laborieuses qui n’ont que leur force de travail pour vivre et qui, parfois, n’en vivent pas. Je vous parle des caissières, des ouvriers de l’agroalimentaire, des artisans du bâtiment, des infirmières, des professeurs, de celles et de ceux que nous avons applaudis à vingt heures et auxquels vous faites payer le «quoi qu’il en coûte». Pour notre part, nous ne croyons pas aux privilégiés d’en bas.\n\nCe qui est en jeu, c’est le juste partage de la valeur entre le capital et le travail. Il faut rendre leur imposition égale, en supprimant la _flat tax_, en rétablissant l’impôt de solidarité sur la fortune –⁠ISF–, en taxant les multinationales qui consolident 40% de leurs résultats dans les paradis fiscaux. Nous voulons également une juste distribution des revenus entre les salariés et les actionnaires, comme entre les salariés eux-mêmes, en limitant les écarts de rémunération de 1 à 20 pour retrouver la «décence commune», souvent évoquée par George Orwell.\n\nMme Nadia Hai\n\nVous voulez qu’on parle du bilan de Hollande?\n\nM. Boris Vallaud\n\nSongez que seulement 0,32% des salariés de notre pays gagnent plus de douze fois le Smic. Si nous redistribuions la masse salariale, nous pourrions augmenter de 233 euros net par mois les revenus de 20% des salariés les plus modestes. Nous ne répondrons pas à la question des salaires si nous ne répondons pas à cette injuste et implacable réalité: les PME paient les impôts des multinationales qui n’en paient pas et les classes moyennes paient les impôts des hyper-riches qui n’en paient pas.\n\nMme Nadia Hai\n\nVous ne répondez à aucune réalité!\n\nM. Boris Vallaud\n\nVous défendez la valeur travail, nous défendons la valeur du travail. Nous voulons la reconnaissance de l’utilité sociale comme mesure de la valeur du travail dans l’emploi et hors de l’emploi. Nous voulons la reconnaissance du travail gratuit, et nous considérons que l’heure est venue d’une radicale reconsidération morale et économique des métiers du soin et du lien ainsi que de l’avènement d’un modèle économique fondé sur la production de l’humanité par l’humain. Au seuil de grandes mutations démographiques et face au défi du grand âge, au cœur d’une révolution numérique et de l’intelligence artificielle, qui n’a donné à voir qu’une part d’elle-même et qui bouleversera nos organisations du travail, plus que jamais, nous avons besoin des infirmières, des aides à domicile, des auxiliaires de vie, des assistants d’éducation, des aides-soignantes. Laissons aux machines le travail de machine et rendons aux humains le travail humain.\n\nQu’est-ce qui fait la valeur? Ce dont nous ne pouvons pas nous passer. En définitive, nous souhaitons bâtir un modèle économique pour le XXI e siècle, où le travail ne serait plus mis au service exclusif de la croissance du PIB mais de la «vie large», comme disait Jaurès, ou de la pleine santé.\n\nCes métiers essentiels sont au cœur des problématiques de genre et des logiques de ségrégation. Voilà les combats jamais achevés qui doivent être les nôtres! Les femmes et les travailleurs étrangers y sont sur-représentés, victimes de bas salaires, de temps partiels subis et du travail fragmenté qui alimentent la pauvreté laborieuse. Vous avez annoncé que les personnels d’entretien de l’administration qui le souhaitent pourraient travailler aux horaires de bureau –⁠fort bien! Pourtant, l’essentiel de ces personnels est employé par des prestataires privés, car vous trouvez là matière à réaliser des économies.\n\nM. Sébastien Jumel\n\nComme à l’Assemblée!\n\nM. Boris Vallaud\n\nLa convention de nettoyage prévoit un seuil de seize heures de travail hebdomadaire minimum. Une fois de plus, vous semblez faire, mais, comme toujours, vous faites semblant.\n\nVous nous avez parlé d’emploi. Or nous préférons parler de travail, si central dans nos vies personnelles comme dans nos sociétés, en tant qu’activité humaine par laquelle les travailleurs transforment le monde naturel et social et se transforment eux-mêmes. Nous voulons parler du mal-travail, des conditions de travail –⁠je constate que vous riez– qui abîment les corps et les âmes, rendent malades et provoquent des décès. Vous faites preuve d’indifférence et ne m’écoutez pas, monsieur le Premier ministre, alors même que vous avez prétendu tendre la main à l’opposition. _(Mme Cyrielle Chatelain et M.Benjamin Lucas applaudissent.)_ Vous êtes sourd à mes propos alors qu’ils concernent un sujet dont vous avez prétendu qu’il était au centre de vos préoccupations.\n\nM. Erwan Balanant\n\nOh, ça va! Il est content de son petit coup!\n\nM. Boris Vallaud\n\nCertains travailleurs perdent le goût et le sens du travail, menacé par son organisation même. L’enjeu est donc de retrouver ce sens, qui se situe à la confluence de l’utilité sociale, de la cohérence éthique et de la réalisation de soi. Nous considérons le travail comme une communauté au service de causes communes et de buts partagés, ceux d’une nation comme ceux d’une entreprise. Je note au passage que le Premier ministre continue de discuter avec ses collègues plutôt que d’écouter l’opposition qui lui parle de travail. Le sens du travail pourrait devenir le nouveau terrain des conquêtes sociales, remettant en cause les rapports de domination et les organisations. Il continue de regarder son téléphone portable! Nous sommes les témoins accablés du peu d’intérêt que le Gouvernement et le Premier ministre portent à l’opposition et au débat parlementaire. _(Applaudissements sur les bancs des groupes SOC, Écolo-NUPES, GDR-NUPES et sur quelques bancs du groupe LFI-NUPES.)_\n\nM. Erwan Balanant\n\nRidicule!\n\nMme Nadia Hai\n\nDites des choses intéressantes, on vous écoutera!\n\nM. Jean-François Coulomme\n\nMépris de classe!\n\nM. Boris Vallaud\n\nNous défendons la nécessité de participer à l’organisation de son travail pour ne pas subir le travail prescrit, qui en fait un travail mort et dépourvu de sens. Et nous ne voulons pas non plus, loin de vos caricatures sur le droit à la paresse, penser séparément le temps de travail et le temps libéré, qui doit également être un temps de citoyenneté active, d’éducation populaire et d’épanouissement personnel. Vous avez supprimé les comités d’hygiène, de sécurité et des conditions de travail –⁠CHSCT–, nous défendons le renforcement du dialogue social, l’instauration du dialogue professionnel et de la codétermination dans l’entreprise.\n\nCe dont il faut se débarrasser –⁠outre vous, monsieur le Premier ministre–, c’est non du travail, mais des rapports de domination. Je poursuis, toujours dans l’indifférence, puisque vous continuez de discuter avec vos collègues assis derrière vous. _(Sourires sur les bancs des groupes SOC et Écolo-NUPES.)_\n\nM. Jérôme Guedj\n\nRachida Dati plutôt que Boris Vallaud!\n\nM. Boris Vallaud\n\nLoin du réarmement civique et de la recivilisation, vous continuez, par votre attitude même, d’être le symbole d’un mépris dont nous savions que vous ne vous départiriez pas. Voilà pourquoi nous luttons contre l’ubérisation du travail et le tâcheronnage préindustriel et nous défendons la présomption de salariat pour les travailleurs des plateformes. Hier, comme aujourd’hui, nous devons toujours mieux civiliser le travail. Or vous n’aspirez qu’à le libéraliser. Monsieur le Premier ministre, vous préférez continuer de vapoter et de papoter avec vos ministres, alors que 152 travailleurs sont morts dans notre pays l’année dernière et que les maladies professionnelles explosent. _(Exclamations sur les bancs des groupes SOC, LFI-NUPES, Écolo-NUPES et GDR-NUPES.)_\n\nM. Jérôme Guedj\n\nÉcoutez Boris Vallaud, écoutez sa voix forte!\n\nM. Boris Vallaud\n\nDans ce contexte, la pleine santé au travail devrait être l’un de vos objectifs. Or votre discours sur le travail est à courte vue. Avec votre vue courte et vos vieilles lunettes, les Français ne vous font pas confiance pour gouverner le pays ni pour tenir le volant. Voilà pourquoi nous voterons la motion de censure. Je vous remercie évidemment pour l’intérêt soutenu que vous avez manifesté à mes propos. _(Applaudissements sur les bancs du groupe SOC dont plusieurs députés se lèvent.)_\n\nM. Jérôme Guedj\n\nEt ils parlent de respect du Parlement! Boris Vallaud est là, en face!\n\nM. Boris Vallaud\n\nNous savons à quel point vous tenez à la coconstruction, au dialogue, à la recherche du compromis. Nous savons que vous tirez toutes les conséquences et toutes les conclusions du parlementarisme de fait issu des urnes, du pluralisme qui peut être dans l’histoire, la source de grandes lois, telles les lois immortelles de la III e République, souvent décriée mais qui fut un régime parlementaire auquel nous tenons. _(Applaudissements sur les bancs du groupe SOC dont plusieurs députés se lèvent, et sur plusieurs bancs des groupes LFI-NUPES, Écolo-NUPES et GDR-NUPES.)_\n\nMme la présidente\n\nLa parole est à Mme Marie-Agnès Poussier-Winsback.\n\nM. Sébastien Jumel\n\nVoyons si Édouard Philippe est critiqué ou non!\n\nMme Marie-Agnès Poussier-Winsback\n\nMonsieur le Premier ministre, vous n’aviez pas encore prononcé votre déclaration de politique générale, mardi dernier, dans cet hémicycle, qu’une motion de censure avait déjà été déposée par les députés de la NUPES, unis comme rarement pour ce grand événement.\n\nM. Sébastien Jumel\n\nCela s’appelle une mesure de précaution!\n\nMme Marie-Agnès Poussier-Winsback\n\nIl s’agissait d’un cadeau de bienvenue, diront certains. C’était un cadeau étonnant, même si, je le reconnais, nos collègues furent très créatifs.\n\nM. Sébastien Jumel\n\nOui, c’est ça!\n\nM. Hadrien Clouet\n\nMerci pour cet hommage!\n\nMme Marie-Agnès Poussier-Winsback\n\nIls ont inventé la censure préventive, renouvelant un genre qu’ils maîtrisent à la perfection. Nul besoin de réagir à votre discours, la censure préventive permet de s’en extraire sans difficulté. Nul besoin d’attendre les premières annonces, les premières orientations de la politique que vous souhaitez mener ni les premiers actes, la censure préventive facilite la tâche.\n\nM. Nicolas Sansu\n\nOn avait entendu Macron!\n\nMme Marie-Agnès Poussier-Winsback\n\nMonsieur le Premier ministre, vous souhaitez «affronter pour avancer». Comptez sur nous, les partisans du «censurer pour tout bloquer» en auront pour leur compte. En effet, le temps est à l’action, alors qu’une partie du pays est en proie au doute, aux colères et aux craintes.\n\nMardi, vous avez présenté une feuille de route…\n\nM. Benjamin Lucas\n\nFeuille de déroute!\n\nMme Marie-Agnès Poussier-Winsback\n\n…claire, s’articulant autour de trois priorités: désmicardiser, débureaucratiser et déverrouiller. Notre pays dispose de formidables atouts qu’il faut continuer à mettre en valeur. Les bonnes volontés sont légion et ne demandent qu’à être libérées. Les agriculteurs présents dans les mobilisations ces derniers jours, nous l’ont dit: ils demandent non l’aumône, mais qu’on leur permette de vivre dignement de leur travail, qu’on arrête de les fliquer, de les traiter comme de potentiels dangers et qu’on les considère simplement pour ce qu’ils sont: des hommes et des femmes qui nous permettent de nous nourrir.\n\nM. Benjamin Lucas\n\nComme les allocataires du RSA et les chômeurs!\n\nMme Marie-Agnès Poussier-Winsback\n\nÀ l’image des agriculteurs, les artisans, les commerçants, les élus locaux, quasiment tous les Français, nous demandent d’en finir avec des réglementations dont ils ne comprennent pas la logique, qu’ils considèrent parfois comme contradictoires voire iniques, qui brident les initiatives, compliquent le quotidien et conduisent parfois à des situations sans queue ni tête. Dès lors, il ne s’agit pas de sabrer aveuglément dans les normes ni de les supprimer au simple motif qu’elles sont précisément des normes. Nos concitoyens nous demandent de replacer le bon sens et la confiance au cœur de la politique. Le bon sens n’est pas un gros mot.\n\nM. Benjamin Lucas\n\nVous êtes à contresens!\n\nMme Marie-Agnès Poussier-Winsback\n\nCe n’est pas non plus l’arbitraire. C’est le retour à des politiques publiques à hauteur d’homme qui sont ancrées dans le quotidien de nos concitoyens pour les servir, et non pour les fliquer; pour leur permettre de vivre paisiblement ensemble, et non pour leur empoisonner la vie.\n\nM. Sébastien Jumel\n\nÇa, c’est le portrait d’Édouard Philippe!\n\nMme Marie-Agnès Poussier-Winsback\n\nLe cri du cœur de nos agriculteurs est transposable dans tous les pans de notre société. Pour le secteur agricole comme pour les autres, chacun doit assumer ses responsabilités. Si l’Union européenne est responsable pour partie de l’inflation normative, l’État ne peut se cacher derrière son petit doigt. Les surtranspositions ne sont pas une exigence de Bruxelles. Les collectivités ne sont pas en reste, même si elles ont fait des efforts. Les législateurs que nous sommes doivent s’interroger sur leur façon de légiférer.\n\nNous devons nous astreindre, autant que possible, à construire et voter des lois claires, simples et lisibles, sans nous perdre dans les détails les plus absurdes. Loin de rester un vœu pieux, tout cela doit se traduire dans les actes, par des lois moins bavardes, adaptées aux besoins de nos concitoyens.\n\nM. Sébastien Jumel\n\nIl faut mettre un frein à l’immobilisme!\n\nMme Marie-Agnès Poussier-Winsback\n\nLibérer les énergies, c’est aussi permettre à chacun de vivre dignement de son travail. Trop de Français ont l’amer sentiment que la différence de niveau de vie entre ceux qui travaillent et ceux qui ne travaillent pas n’est pas à la hauteur de leurs investissements, parfois de leurs sacrifices. Ils ont l’impression de beaucoup payer pour les autres et de recevoir trop peu.\n\nDésmicardiser la France, c’est dire à chacun de nos compatriotes qu’il vivra dignement de son travail; que s’il fournit les efforts, il en récoltera les fruits, notamment par le salaire.\n\nM. Benjamin Lucas\n\nLes Français ne font pas déjà des efforts, franchement?\n\nMme Marie-Agnès Poussier-Winsback\n\nC’est surtout dire que si le Smic est un progrès social, il ne peut et ne doit pas être la seule perspective d’une carrière professionnelle. Enfin, c’est tenir la promesse que lorsque l’on travaille, on ne peut pas être en situation de pauvreté financière. Cela n’est plus tolérable.\n\nM. Pierre Dharréville\n\nIl faut augmenter les salaires!\n\nMme Marie-Agnès Poussier-Winsback\n\nL’impression de contribuer beaucoup est mêlée à celle de ne pas recevoir assez; au sentiment que malgré un niveau d’imposition élevé, une dépense publique parmi les plus élevées du monde et des finances publiques à la corde, on ne sait pas vraiment où va son argent. Nous devons lutter pied à pied contre la dégradation de certains services publics. Rappelons cependant que, d’ores et déjà, beaucoup a été fait pour réarmer le régalien et les services publics essentiels. Tout cela prend toutefois du temps, et le sous-investissement chronique dans certains services publics, depuis des années, laisse des traces tenaces.\n\nLa transition écologique, qui est le défi de notre siècle, nécessite de la même façon des investissements massifs ainsi que des mesures courageuses et compréhensibles. L’État n’est pas le seul à mener ces grandes batailles: il doit embarquer les collectivités territoriales qui sont souvent un maillon pertinent et efficace pour permettre l’accès à des services publics de qualité.\n\nM. Nicolas Sansu\n\nLes collectivités sont maltraitées!\n\nMme Marie-Agnès Poussier-Winsback\n\nPour cela, il faut faire confiance aux élus locaux qui ont une connaissance précise de leurs territoires et des besoins de leurs populations. Là encore, des solutions de bon sens, car prises au plus près du terrain, sont à même d’améliorer bien des situations.\n\nL’annonce de la présentation, avant 2025, d’un projet de loi de simplification de l’action publique locale est à souligner. Nous formons le vœu qu’il soit coconstruit avec et pour les élus locaux, formidables gardiens de l’action publique partout en France.\n\nIl faut enfin continuer à restaurer l’autorité: à l’école bien sûr, où vous aviez annoncé un cap et des décisions très claires lorsque vous étiez rue de Grenelle, mais plus généralement partout dans la société.\n\nM. Adrien Quatennens\n\nEt les patrons voyous?\n\nMme Marie-Agnès Poussier-Winsback\n\nLes millions de Français qui respectent chaque jour les règles ne supportent plus de voir une poignée d’individus s’en affranchir. La délinquance doit être réprimée avec sévérité et les incivilités ne faire l’objet d’aucune mansuétude. Ce sont précisément les incivilités qui grèvent le pacte social et nourrissent l’exaspération de nos concitoyens.\n\nM. Hadrien Clouet\n\nAu collège Stanislas aussi?\n\nMme Marie-Agnès Poussier-Winsback\n\nLes incivilités ne concernent-elles que les jeunes, messieurs de la NUPES?\n\nM. Hadrien Clouet\n\nIl n’y a pas que des jeunes à Stanislas!\n\nMme Marie-Agnès Poussier-Winsback\n\nCeux qui ne respectent pas les règles essentielles à la vie en société doivent se les voir rappeler avec fermeté. Vous l’avez souligné de manière on ne peut plus claire mardi dernier, monsieur le Premier ministre, en demandant d’«en revenir à un principe clair: «tu casses, tu répares; tu salis, tu nettoies; tu défies l’autorité, on t’apprend à la respecter»!» _(Exclamations sur les bancs du groupe LFI-NUPES.)_\n\nM. Hadrien Clouet\n\nPayer ses impôts, ce serait déjà un bon début!\n\nM. Benjamin Lucas\n\n«Tar’ ta gueule à la récré»!\n\nM. Yannick Monnet\n\nTu mens, tu démissionnes!\n\nMme Marie-Agnès Poussier-Winsback\n\nVous l’aurez compris, nous nous retrouvons pleinement dans les priorités que vous avez énoncées et dans les grands axes que vous souhaitez suivre.\n\nLa parole était claire, les actes doivent désormais la traduire concrètement. Monsieur le Premier ministre, le groupe Horizons et apparentés est et sera à vos côtés pour permettre le plein succès de votre politique, pour la réussite de la France et l’amélioration des conditions de vie de nos concitoyens. _(Applaudissements sur les bancs des groupes HOR, RE et Dem.)_\n\nMme la présidente\n\nLa parole est à M.Benjamin Lucas.\n\nM. Benjamin Lucas\n\nMonsieur le Premier ministre, vous êtes né en 1989.\n\nMme Prisca Thevenot, ministre déléguée chargée du renouveau démocratique, porte-parole du Gouvernement\n\nVous avez bien compris!\n\nM. Benjamin Lucas\n\nJordan Bardella est né en 1995. Tous deux, vous vous proclamez porte-paroles de notre génération, faisant de votre âge un fait politique. Soit. Je suis né en 1990, alors permettez-moi de faire irruption pour un instant dans ce duel si souvent transformé en duo.\n\nM. Erwan Balanant\n\nMoi je suis né en 1971!\n\nM. Benjamin Lucas\n\nPour vous et lui, la jeunesse est un alibi: M.Bardella veut ainsi faire oublier qu’il dirige un parti vieux d’un demi-siècle, fondé par d’anciens collaborateurs des nazis, animé par les obsessions identitaires et les pulsions racistes. _(Applaudissements sur quelques bancs des groupes LFI-NUPES et SOC.)_ Il est pourtant bel et bien à la tête d’un vieux clan, sous surveillance de l’héritière.\n\nMonsieur Attal,…\n\nMme Sylvie Retailleau, ministre\n\nMonsieur le Premier ministre!\n\nM. Benjamin Lucas\n\n…votre parcours est l’aveu d’un parti qui, lui non plus, ne revendique aucune histoire, aucune mémoire ni aucune conviction et n’a donc d’autre boussole que l’opportunisme érigé en méthode de gouvernement _(L’orateur désigne les bancs du Gouvernement) –_ la preuve.\n\nM. Erwan Balanant\n\nIl parle des Verts!\n\nM. Benjamin Lucas\n\nLa jeunesse est pour moi le renouveau d’une histoire, pas son déni. Nous nous reconnaissons en effet dans un clivage consubstantiel à la République, entre la gauche et la droite. Notre avantage par rapport à vous? Nous entrons ici avec deux siècles d’expérience, avec un héritage collectif et des convictions qui obligent à l’humilité. _(Exclamations sur les bancs du groupe RE.)_\n\nDans cet héritage, au-dessus de tout, il y a la République. La mission historique de la gauche est de la défendre quand elle est menacée, de la rétablir quand elle est effondrée, mais aussi de la revendiquer quand elle est dévoyée.\n\nAu fond, monsieur Attal, vous êtes le meilleur ami de M.Bardella.\n\nM. Alain David\n\nAttal, Bardella, même combat!\n\nMme Caroline Abadie\n\nHein?\n\nM. Benjamin Lucas\n\nPlus vous disloquez le pacte républicain construit autour de nos services publics, plus vous abîmez le contrat social et les mécanismes qui l’ont préservé depuis 1945, plus vous agitez les thèmes et les termes de l’extrême droite… plus il y a de place pour la discorde, la fracture et finalement la haine des Français les uns envers les autres, donc plus il y a de place pour l’extrême droite.\n\nVous êtes même parfois le frère jumeau de M.Bardella: quand il s’agit d’infliger du travail forcé aux allocataires du RSA –⁠on l’a vu hier–⁠; quand, pour la première fois depuis la seconde guerre mondiale, votre majorité vote une loi relative à l’immigration avec le soutien de l’extrême droite _(Applaudissements sur les bancs des groupes Écolo-NUPES et LFI-NUPES)_; quand vous reprenez les slogans de la chaîne de M.Bolloré et lui offrez le départ des rares ministres qui osent dire la vérité à son sujet.\n\nVous êtes enfin le jumeau de M.Bardella pour ce qui concerne la conception de l’école. Je m’y attarderai un instant parce que celle-ci est au cœur de la refondation du pacte républicain. Vous et lui partagez un même diagnostic –⁠c’est le monde vu par CNews: l’école serait malade d’un manque d’autorité. La réalité, c’est qu’elle est malade d’un manque d’égalité. L’école de notre pays est en effet comme un hôpital qui soignerait très bien les patients, dès lors qu’ils sont en bonne santé –⁠le lieu de la reproduction sociale. Cette situation, vous voulez l’amplifier, car vous êtes habité par une vision de la société et de l’école qu’avait parfaitement bien résumée le président Macron lui-même, avec d’un côté ceux qui réussissent et, de l’autre, ceux qui ne sont rien.\n\nSelon cette vision, la réussite des meilleurs pourrait être entravée par ceux qui n’y arrivent pas aussi bien. De cette analyse procède aussi la validation morale du séparatisme scolaire, du refus de la mixité –⁠y compris de genre– au plus haut sommet du ministère de l’éducation nationale. Vous considérez la République et son école comme un casino: faisons l’«égalité des chances», et advienne que pourra!\n\nFace à vos obsessions inégalitaires, j’assume quant à moi l’obsession de l’égalité. Nous refusons de croire à vos fables d’une école d’antan fantasmée. Nous voulons donner à l’école la force de la promesse républicaine, en lui octroyant les moyens nécessaires pour accomplir sa mission, en repensant la façon dont on enseigne et dont on apprend, en renforçant, par l’éducation populaire, la culture, le droit aux vacances ainsi que l’alliance éducative qui permet à chaque élève de trouver confiance en lui.\n\nVous êtes en train de casser notre service public d’éducation, pas après pas, marche après marche, sans que la représentation nationale puisse donner son avis, et encore moins son aval. Le collège unique, c’est apprendre et faire société ensemble, pas apprendre séparément avec le même uniforme dans le même lieu. La décision de mettre en place des groupes de niveau, qui vont assigner à résidence toute une population d’élèves fragiles, majoritairement issue des catégories populaires, ne peut se faire par simple décret. Nous vous demandons, monsieur le Premier ministre, de surseoir à ce projet pour permettre aux parlementaires d’en débattre et de trancher la question.\n\nTocqueville écrivait: «Dans les démocraties, chaque génération est un peuple nouveau.» La question qui se pose dès lors à notre génération est celle de savoir quel peuple nous voulons être. Notre génération, qui est la première à être pleinement consciente du péril mortel pour l’humanité que représente le réchauffement climatique, celle pour laquelle a été inventé le concept d’éco-anxiété, aspire à être le peuple d’une République écologique, où l’on ne se bat pas pour l’accès à l’eau, où l’on retrouve le plaisir d’une nature débarrassée des entrepôts géants et de la bétonnisation à outrance.\n\nNotre génération, qui grandit dans la certitude qu’elle vivra moins bien que les précédentes et fait plus que les autres l’expérience de la précarité, aspire à former un peuple solidaire, épris de justice et d’égale dignité des êtres. Il n’est en effet pas facile d’avoir 24 ans en 2024.\n\nNotre génération, ouverte au monde, qui vit la pluralité et la diversité comme la grande richesse de la nation, aspire à être un peuple qui vit en paix et dans le respect de chacune et de chacun; une société débarrassée du racisme, des discriminations, du sexisme, de l’homophobie.\n\nNotre génération, la plus informée et la plus connectée de l’histoire, aspire à être un peuple citoyen, dans une démocratie vivante, bouillonnante, dans laquelle un président de la République ne peut se passer du consentement des électeurs ou de leur Parlement, ni mépriser les syndicats, les associations, les contre-pouvoirs locaux ou le pouvoir judiciaire.\n\nNotre génération, qui est suffisamment adulte, aspire à être un peuple qui se construit par la conviction plus que par l’injonction. Elle ne veut pas de votre service national obligatoire! Les valeurs de la République ne s’apprennent pas dans les casernes, elles doivent s’éprouver dans la vie quotidienne de chacun –⁠je pense notamment aux jeunes des quartiers populaires.\n\nNotre génération aspire à l’audace, celle qui ouvre le champ des possibles, qui donne à la politique et à l’engagement toute leur beauté. Vous avez d’ailleurs achevé votre discours de politique générale en citant Danton: «De l’audace, encore de l’audace, toujours de l’audace».\n\nDe l’audace, il en faut pour abolir les privilèges, monsieur le Premier ministre, pas pour les faire perdurer; il en faut pour engager la révolution écologique, pas pour céder aux lobbys; pour penser un autre modèle que celui qui est obsédé par la croissance et le profit, pas pour tenter de faire vivre sous perfusion le vieux modèle productiviste et les dogmes néolibéraux du millénaire dernier; il en faut pour éradiquer la pauvreté et partager les richesses, pas pour stigmatiser les plus pauvres et les priver de droit au bonheur; pour que l’on travaille mieux, moins et tous, pas pour fliquer les chômeurs, négliger les souffrances au travail et ne pas rémunérer dignement celles et ceux qui n’ont que cette force de travail pour vivre; il en faut pour offrir un logement digne à chaque Français, pas pour démanteler la loi SRU; pour les protéger de l’inflation, de ce calvaire que devient chaque passage à la caisse du supermarché, pas pour minimiser la réalité de leurs difficultés.\n\nOù est l’audace dans le macronisme de M.Attal? Pour les cabinets de conseil qui écrivent les éléments de langage de la majorité, votre nomination devait incarner le retour à l’esprit du «nouveau monde» de 2017. Quelle prétention, tout de même, de s’arroger sans cesse le mérite de nous faire changer d’époque! La «renaissance», c’était autrement plus «disruptif» –⁠comme vous pourriez dire– qu’un remaniement qui consacre le retour de vieilles gloires des gouvernements Raffarin ou Fillon.\n\nOù est l’audace dans le lepénisme de M.Bardella? Les députés du groupe Rassemblement national maquillent leurs convictions pour mieux duper les Français quant à la réalité de leur projet. Ils ne font que des coups tactiques, uniquement pour attraper chaque colère qui passe.\n\nL’audace est chez celles et ceux qui croient qu’un autre monde est possible, qui veulent agir à la racine des désordres qui minent la société, abolir la violence des injustices, la chappe de plomb inégalitaire qui étouffe le pays. L’audace, plus que jamais, c’est renouer avec le serment humaniste, avec la République sociale.\n\nJe le dis, et c’est une profession de foi: nous ne vous laisserons pas enfermer la démocratie française dans ce tête à tête mortifère pour la République que vous mettez en scène avec M.Bardella. Nous serons au rendez-vous des combats pour défendre les Français face aux urgences de leur quotidien et aux méfaits de votre politique. Enfin nous serons là, le moment venu, unis, pour leur proposer le projet qui relèvera les grands défis de l’avenir de la nation. _(Applaudissements sur les bancs des groupes LFI-NUPES, SOC, Écolo-NUPES et GDR-NUPES.)_\n\nMme la présidente\n\nLa parole est à M.Nicolas Sansu.\n\nM. Hadrien Clouet\n\nC’est la motion de Sansu!\n\nM. Nicolas Sansu\n\nAu nom du groupe Gauche démocrate et républicaine, qui rassemble les députés communistes et progressistes ultramarins, il me revient d’incarner une voix singulière, qui ne s’éteint pas devant les forces du marché; une voix qui, au cours de l’histoire, a fait se rencontrer ceux qui croyaient au ciel et ceux qui n’y croyaient pas; qui n’a jamais cessé, non seulement de crier face aux injustices, mais aussi de proposer la justice afin que nos principes et nos valeurs cessent d’être dévoyés.\n\nMonsieur le Premier ministre, vous avez dit, mardi dernier, que nous avions la France en partage. Or depuis trop d’années, de recul en recul, de casse de l’assurance chômage en casse de la retraite par répartition, c’est la France sans partage que vous insufflez. Une France sans partage qui oublie son rôle sur la scène internationale, qui oublie de défendre partout dans le monde, bien qu’elle soit membre du Conseil de sécurité de l’ONU, l’exigence de fraternité.\n\nDe Gaza à l’Ukraine, du Soudan au Yémen, partout dans le monde, la voix de la France doit se confondre avec la paix. Les mots du grand Victor Hugo nous le rappellent:\n\n«Hommes que j’entrevois,\n\nDans l’assourdissement des trompettes farouches,\n\nPlus forts que des lions et plus vains que des mouches,\n\nPour le plaisir de qui vous exterminez-vous?\n\nTous n’avez qu’un seul droit, c’est de vous aimer tous.»\n\nOui, monsieur le Premier ministre, la fraternité, c’est l’humanité! Face aux drames qui, chaque jour plus nombreux, se nouent à Gaza, la France ne peut accepter que la famine et les épidémies soient orchestrées pour servir d’arme de guerre, car cela confine à l’inhumanité,… _(Applaudissements sur les bancs des groupes GDR-NUPES, LFI-NUPES et Écolo-NUPES.)_\n\nM. Jean-Paul Lecoq\n\nCessez-le-feu!\n\nM. Nicolas Sansu\n\n…cette inhumanité qui vous a conduit à transiger sur les thèses d’extrême droite les plus indignes lorsque vous avez accepté _de facto_ des dispositions reprenant la préférence nationale, au mépris de la vie d’enfants, de femmes et d’hommes qui, dans l’espoir d’une vie meilleure, risquent leur peau en bravant les flots sur des rafiots pour fuir la guerre, la famine, les conséquences du réchauffement climatique, la colonisation économique ou les persécutions politiques.\n\nUne France sans partage, c’est une France qui accepte sans sourciller que le glaive de la finance règne et mette à mal la route vers l’égalité.\n\nQuelque 330 000 personnes sont sans domicile fixe; leur nombre a doublé en dix ans! Chaque soir, des milliers d’enfants sont livrés à la rue,…\n\nM. Jean-Paul Lecoq\n\nIls sont soixante et un au Havre!\n\nM. Nicolas Sansu\n\n…ce qui contredit les promesses présidentielles dévoyées et envolées.\n\nDe fait, en quelques années, vous avez asséché notre capacité collective à produire du logement social, laissé prospérer tous les ressorts de la spéculation et manqué le tournant de la rénovation de l’habitat. Désormais, vous souhaitez amoindrir la portée de la loi SRU, qui est un outil de cohésion et de mixité sociale, donnant ainsi un satisfecit à ceux qui la contournent depuis tant d’années.\n\nMonsieur le Premier ministre, un toit, c’est un droit! Mal loger des millions d’habitants de notre pays, c’est trahir notre pacte républicain. _(Applaudissements sur les bancs des groupes GDR-NUPES, LFI-NUPES et Écolo-NUPES.)_\n\nUne France sans partage, c’est une France qui instille le poison de la division: entre salariés et chômeurs, entre allocataires des minima sociaux et classes moyennes, entre Français et immigrés. Pourtant, tous ceux-là seront unis lorsqu’il leur faudra régler une facture d’électricité qui va encore augmenter de 10% ce mois-ci, soit une hausse de 44% en deux ans! _(M.Sébastien Jumel applaudit.)_ Tous ceux-là, du retraité à l’enseignant, du smicard au petit commerçant, du cadre moyen au paysan, vont voir leur pouvoir de vivre rogné par l’inflation, qui fait tant de mal.\n\nComment ne pas voir votre souci de la division dans le fait que vous ne pointez jamais du doigt les vrais profiteurs, cette petite caste de privilégiés qui parvient trop souvent à rester sous les radars. «La plus belle des ruses du diable est de vous persuader qu’il n’existe pas», écrivait Baudelaire. La plus belle des ruses des ultrariches et de tenter de nous faire accroire qu’ils n’existent pas, pourrait-on paraphraser.\n\nMme Raquel Garrido\n\nIls sont au Gouvernement!\n\nM. Nicolas Sansu\n\nTous milliardaires, claironnait Emmanuel Macron, qui souhaitait que ce soit là le projet de vie de notre jeunesse. Mais il y a loin de la coupe aux lèvres, car, pendant qu’on illusionne, la reproduction sociale fonctionne à plein, jusqu’à la caricature au sein du Gouvernement. _(Applaudissements sur les bancs des groupes GDR-NUPES, LFI-NUPES et Écolo-NUPES.)_\n\nUne France sans partage n’a pas d’avenir, monsieur le Premier ministre. En moins de trois ans, tandis que vous piétinez le monde du travail en le précarisant, la fortune cumulée des milliardaires a plus que doublé dans notre pays, atteignant plus de 1 200 milliards d’euros. Comment vous y prenez-vous pour réfréner cette indécence et faire trembler nos superprofiteurs? Vous affichez un froncement de sourcil, voire une moue significative: c’est tout!\n\nDes dividendes records –⁠près de 100 milliards d’euros versés cette année–, de multiples dispositifs pour échapper à l’impôt et transférer tout ou partie de son patrimoine dans des contrées à fiscalité douce, comme on dit, et des rachats d’actions: voilà ce qui fait la France sans partage!\n\nNous avons un principe à vous proposer: «Tu te casses avec tes dividendes? Tu paies et on répare!»; «Tu salis la France en partant avec ta fortune dans un paradis fiscal? Tu es taxé et on nettoie!» _(Sourires et applaudissements sur les bancs des groupes GDR-NUPES et LFI-NUPES ainsi que sur plusieurs bancs du groupe Écolo-NUPES.)_ De fait, l’autorité qui confine à l’autoritarisme ne s’applique pas à tous. Autoritaire avec les petits, libéral avec les puissants: tel est votre _credo_.\n\nContrairement à cette France sans partage, nous œuvrons pour une France du commun. Notre pays est riche, immensément riche, et il s’est construit sur des principes collectifs qui font notre fierté. Il est encore temps de retisser ce fil, dans tous les domaines: la santé, l’éducation, la sécurité et la tranquillité publiques, la souveraineté, la solidarité envers les plus fragiles.\n\nCe qui compte, c’est la visée. Prenons l’exemple de la santé. Il existe une alternative, en la matière. La première branche de cette alternative, celle que vous avez choisie, consiste à accroître le reste à charge pour les malades, à favoriser le privé plutôt que le public, à oublier la prévention… C’est, en quelque sorte, la peinture anglo-saxonne qui vient flétrir notre tableau de la prise en charge de la solidarité.\n\nMais il y a l’autre branche, celle qui consiste à progresser vers le 100% sécu financé par des cotisations sociales pleines et entières, à remettre en cause des milliards d’euros d’exonérations inefficaces et à élaborer, ainsi que le demandent les représentants des personnels hospitaliers et la Fédération hospitalière de France, un véritable plan de reconquête de l’accès aux soins pour tous.\n\nAnnoncer, ou laisser subodorer, au cours de la même allocution, et une extension des baisses de cotisations sociales et une amélioration du financement des besoins de la protection sociale, c’est juste une illusion, rien qu’une simulation.\n\nM. Jean-Paul Lecoq\n\nUn mensonge!\n\nM. Nicolas Sansu\n\nMonsieur le Premier ministre, à l’instar des agriculteurs, qui ont besoin que les prix soient rémunérateurs et que les pays qui commercent respectent les mêmes règles et les mêmes normes, les salariés ont besoin d’être mieux payés et d’être protégés contre le dumping social, et les entreprises, notamment les PME, d’être préservées du dumping fiscal.\n\nCe sont ces principes simples qui permettront de redonner au pays de la force et à nos concitoyens la capacité de construire ensemble et de répondre aux urgences écologique, sociale et démocratique.\n\nFaire communauté, c’est tout le contraire du séparatisme social qui déferle sur des pans entiers de notre pays.\n\nÀ cet égard, l’école est, au-delà des polémiques, un véritable enjeu. La question est simple: les moyens mis à la disposition d’un lycéen de Félix-Éboué à Cayenne ou de Paul-Éluard à Saint-Denis sont-ils les mêmes que ceux mis à la disposition d’un lycéen de Stanislas à Paris?\n\nM. Sébastien Jumel\n\nNon!\n\nM. Nicolas Sansu\n\nSûrement pas. Il n’y a, entre ces lycéens, aucune égalité de moyens et encore moins d’égalité de traitement. Les enseignants ont su vous le montrer jeudi dernier, en participant à un mouvement qui en appelle d’autres.\n\nJe pourrais décliner cette démonstration à l’envi, en évoquant notamment la catastrophe annoncée de la présentation de cartes scolaires dans les départements, qui auront pour conséquence de véritables abandons territoriaux. Votre défiance envers les collectivités locales, dont vous tentez de rogner le pouvoir d’agir et la liberté, ressemble à un péché originel.\n\nL’égal accès de tous aux grands services publics régaliens ou aux services au public a été non seulement négligé, mais dépecé, au risque de superposer exclusion sociale et exclusion territoriale, dans les quartiers populaires, la ruralité ou les territoires d’outre-mer. Le groupe GDR-NUPES défendra donc plusieurs textes pour exiger le respect du droit commun dans tous les territoires de la République. Nous proposerons ainsi de créer une commission d’enquête et nous déposerons des propositions de loi qui visent à garantir le respect de nos concitoyens des territoires dits d’outre-mer.\n\nMonsieur le Premier ministre, avant de conclure, je veux souligner combien nous regrettons votre choix de ne pas solliciter la confiance de l’Assemblée nationale. _(Mme Raquel Garrido et M.Benjamin Lucas applaudissent.)_ Les petites phrases, parfois doucereuses, sur le respect du Parlement et des oppositions –⁠la porte est ouverte, dit-on– sont de peu de poids face aux 49.3 tonnes qui nous écrasent sans ménagement. _(Applaudissements sur quelques bancs des groupes LFI-NUPES et Écolo-NUPES.)_\n\nMme Raquel Garrido\n\nBien dit!\n\nM. Nicolas Sansu\n\nLe respect des parlementaires passera nécessairement par la fin de cette conduite addictive au 49.3. N’oubliez pas que lorsque vous piétinez l’Assemblée, c’est sur les Français que vous vous essuyez les pieds!\n\nM. Benjamin Lucas\n\nExactement!\n\nM. Nicolas Sansu\n\nParce que nous ne nous résignons pas à une société qui sombrerait dans un autoritarisme social mâtiné de libéralisme économique, non plus qu’à une dérive qui fait le lit des ennemis de la démocratie, nous voterons sans trembler pour cette motion de censure, le seul acte qui nous permet de témoigner notre défiance et, surtout, notre combativité et notre vigilance pour faire triompher les espoirs et les besoins d’un peuple uni.\n\n«Entre l’avoir, l’être, le savoir, le faire, le paraître et le pouvoir, qui absorbent toutes nos énergies, l’avoir l’emporte aujourd’hui, car il donne le pouvoir, permet le paraître, domine le faire et dispense d’être et de savoir», disait Edgar Pisani. Monsieur le Premier ministre, ne laissez pas l’avoir l’emporter et emporter tout sur son passage, jusqu’à favoriser l’arrivée au pouvoir des ennemis de la République et de la démocratie! _(Applaudissements sur les bancs des groupes GDR-NUPES, LFI-NUPES, SOC et Écolo-NUPES.)_\n\nMme la présidente\n\nLa parole est à M.Stéphane Lenormand.\n\nM. Stéphane Lenormand\n\nNous vivons une situation politique inédite, pour ne pas dire une anomalie démocratique, puisque le Gouvernement affronte sa première motion de censure alors même qu’il n’est pas encore entièrement constitué.\n\nLe scénario avait été écrit par d’éminents stratèges, aidés de brillants communicants: il s’agissait de feuilletonner la composition du Gouvernement et d’étirer la séquence pour montrer que le Président reste le maître du jeu politique. Las! cette belle stratégie a été percutée par un mouvement de colère agricole de grande ampleur. Le maître des horloges s’est heurté à la réalité d’un pays fracturé; j’y reviendrai.\n\nMonsieur le Premier ministre, j’ai entendu votre volontarisme: l’action, l’action, l’action, avez-vous dit! Or, depuis quatre semaines, c’est plutôt: l’attente, l’attente, l’attente… En effet, près d’un mois après la démission d’Élisabeth Borne, plusieurs ministères restent désespérément vacants, dans une sorte de latence du pouvoir.\n\nPas de ministre du logement, bien que le secteur traverse une crise structurelle et que nos concitoyens nous disent leurs difficultés à se loger. Nous avons entendu vos propositions en matière de simplification et d’accélération des procédures. Suffiront-elles à enrayer la crise? Quid des modifications que vous entendez apporter à la loi SRU? Si elles vont dans le sens d’un détricotage, je tiens à vous rappeler, l’impératif de mixité et de cohésion sociale.\n\nPas de ministre délégué aux outre-mer non plus, alors que Mayotte connaît une flambée de violence. Comment ne pas se sentir considéré comme un Français de seconde zone lorsqu’on vient de ces territoires éloignés de l’Hexagone? Nous avons déjà eu trois ministres des outre-mer différents depuis 2022, et on nous annonce la nomination d’un quatrième… Nous continuons de demander non seulement l’adaptation de chaque grand projet de loi aux spécificités ultramarines dès la conception du texte, mais aussi une grande loi de programmation pour les outre-mer.\n\nPas de ministre délégué à la santé non plus, ce champ étant noyé dans le périmètre de trois anciens ministères. Pourtant, combien de fois avons-nous relayé, dans cet hémicycle, les inquiétudes de nos concitoyens concernant l’accès aux soins, la désertification médicale et la fermeture des services d’urgence? Nous avons alerté le Gouvernement sur la fatigue des soignants et des personnels hospitaliers: notre hôpital et, de manière générale, notre système de santé sont à bout de souffle. Faut-il, là aussi, attendre une révolte pour agir?\n\nNous avons pris bonne note de vos engagements: un service d’accès aux soins par département, la régularisation de médecins étrangers et le recrutement d’assistants médicaux. Mais vous n’avez rien dit, ou si peu, de la trajectoire financière et de l’organisation de l’hôpital.\n\nQuant à l’éducation, vous l’avez érigée en priorité, mais les polémiques sans fin qui entourent la ministre de l’éducation nationale brouillent le message. Deux questions, cependant: la généralisation de l’uniforme est-elle la solution? La mise en place de groupes de niveau au collège améliorera-t-elle le niveau général? Soyons sérieux: arrêtons les communications à deux balles et travaillons sur le fond!\n\nMonsieur le Premier ministre, vous avez annoncé un gouvernement resserré. Pourquoi pas? Mais il faut vite qu’il soit au complet, car les chantiers ne manquent pas et ils doivent être conduits –⁠ce qui rend l’exercice plus complexe encore– dans un contexte où notre déficit est l’un des plus importants de la zone euro et où la remontée des taux d’intérêt plane comme une menace sur les prochains mois. Cela ne vous a pas empêché de promettre une baisse d’impôts de 2 milliards, lesquels s’ajoutent aux 12 milliards d’euros d’économies prévues par ailleurs. Où allez-vous faire des coupes?\n\nCes derniers jours, les députés du groupe LIOT ont fait le choix, au terme de longs échanges, de ne pas voter pour cette motion de censure. Nous restons fidèles à ce qui est notre _credo_ depuis 2022: notre groupe entend être un groupe d’opposition et de propositions. En effet, nous ne nous retrouvons pas dans les gesticulations et la recherche du coup d’éclat permanent. Nos concitoyens nous le disent: ils s’opposent à cette stratégie du bruit et de la fureur, et veulent que l’on apporte des solutions équilibrées à leurs problèmes.\n\nNéanmoins, je le rappelle encore une fois, les Français ont choisi de ne donner au Président et au Gouvernement qu’une majorité relative. Ce faisant, ils vous ont enjoint de travailler différemment, moins verticalement, en recourant davantage à la concertation. C’est d’ailleurs la promesse qui avait été faite au lendemain des élections législatives; elle n’a guère été tenue par votre prédécesseure, ou très peu. Nous vous rappellerons donc cette méthode autant qu’il le faudra.\n\nMonsieur le Premier ministre, votre discours de politique générale, qui semble marquer une inflexion, soulève à tout le moins quelques questions.\n\nLes premières portent sur les réponses que vous apportez à la crise agricole. L’ampleur de la mobilisation révèle un monde agricole à cran. Les députés de mon groupe avaient pourtant alerté le Gouvernement, ces derniers mois, sur l’amoncellement des normes, l’enfer administratif des aides versées au titre de la politique agricole commune (PAC), les conséquences du dérèglement climatique et la multiplication des crises –⁠je pense notamment à celle de la grippe aviaire, lors de laquelle mon collègue David Taupiac s’était mobilisé. Nous avons également, comme beaucoup, souligné l’insuffisance des lois Egalim de 2018, 2021 et 2023, pour rééquilibrer les relations commerciales et permettre simplement à nos agriculteurs de vivre de leur travail.\n\nPourtant, le Gouvernement ne semblait pas avoir pris la mesure des problèmes, comme en témoigne la faiblesse du projet de loi d’orientation agricole, retiré en catastrophe pour –⁠nous l’espérons tous– être renforcé. Depuis, nous avons pris connaissance des propositions que vous avez faites ces deniers jours dans l’espoir d’éteindre l’incendie. Ainsi, dans le contexte inflationniste actuel, votre recul sur le gazole non routier (GNR) est un soulagement bienvenu. En revanche, nous nous interrogeons sur la simplification des aides de la PAC. Au-delà des mesures d’urgence, les solutions passent par davantage de décentralisation afin de réduire les délais d’attente, actuellement incompréhensibles.\n\nJe dois vous dire nos réserves sur vos propositions concernant le rééquilibrage des relations commerciales. Davantage de contrôles, oui, mais cela ne suffira pas, tant les causes du problème sont profondes. Il faut que cessent les pressions à la baisse sur les prix des matières premières agricoles.\n\nLes députés du groupe LIOT se sont également mobilisés contre les grands accords de libre-échange, qui introduisent une concurrence déloyale et favorisent le moins-disant social et environnemental. Outre l’abandon de l’accord avec le Mercosur, nous plaidons pour que la France défende à l’échelle européenne l’instauration de clauses miroirs comme préalable à toute discussion.\n\nNous avons été très étonnés par la quasi-absence, dans votre discours de politique générale, de propositions sur le pouvoir d’achat, comme si le problème avait disparu de vos radars. Pourtant, la question de la vie chère reste une des premières préoccupations de nos concitoyens, dans l’Hexagone comme dans les outre-mer. L’inflation ralentit, certes, mais les prix ne baissent pas vraiment.\n\nÀ ce propos, nous avions obtenu de votre prédécesseure une extension du chèque carburant versé aux Français des classes populaires et moyennes qui utilisent leur voiture. Bien qu’elle ait été inscrite dans le budget pour 2024, cette mesure a été en partie remise en cause par le ministre de l’économie. Ma question est donc simple: quand entrera-t-elle en vigueur?\n\nPoser la question du pouvoir d’achat, c’est poser aussi la question des salaires. Nous soutenons votre volonté de «désmicardiser» le pays. Les députés du groupe LIOT se retrouvent sur ce point: il faut que le travail paye. Nous avons pointé l’écrasement de l’échelle des salaires au niveau du Smic, et celui des carrières passées au Smic, ou rattrapées par le Smic.\n\nVous avez annoncé une remise à plat du système d’aides et d’exonérations dans le prochain budget. Il s’agit d’un chantier d’ampleur. Vous nous trouverez à vos côtés, si cette réforme concilie deux impératifs: faciliter la progression des salaires et financer le système de protection sociale.\n\nParler de travail, c’est aussi évoquer votre projet de réforme de l’assurance chômage. Vous défendrez probablement un nouveau durcissement; vous avez déjà annoncé la suppression de l’allocation de solidarité spécifique (ASS) que touchent les chômeurs en fin de droits. Nous serons particulièrement attentifs à l’emploi des seniors. Comme nous l’avons dit lors de la réforme des retraites, il faut un grand plan en faveur de l’emploi des seniors. Je veux aussi vous mettre en garde contre un raisonnement un peu simpliste, qui rendrait les demandeurs d’emploi responsables de la hausse attendue, ces prochains mois, du taux de chômage dans notre pays.\n\nVous avez également évoqué le dispositif de «solidarité à la source», en préparation depuis de nombreux mois, et dont la concrétisation ne semble pas une priorité. Quand comptez-vous achever cette réforme?\n\nCela conduit à l’un des principaux maux dont souffre notre pays: la complexité et l’accumulation des normes. Il y a quelques semaines, j’interrogeais le ministre de l’intérieur sur la situation ubuesque de l’importation des armes et des munitions à Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon. Nous savons tous que simplifier est complexe. Il s’agit d’un travail de fourmi, qui doit être mené patiemment. Des modifications législatives devront être apportées, et nous y serons attentifs, notamment à l’occasion de l’examen du second projet de loi sur l’industrie verte que vous avez annoncé. Notre collègue Christophe Naegelen, président du groupe d’études sur la simplification administrative, est engagé sur cette question.\n\nUn autre grand mal de notre pays est son extrême centralisation. Cette pratique si verticale du pouvoir renforce le sentiment d’éloignement que ressentent les Français. Il faut décomplexifier, comme il faut décentraliser et déconcentrer notre pays. Il faut aller jusqu’à différencier et adapter les normes, dans l’Hexagone comme dans les outre-mer. Je pense aussi à la Corse, où des discussions visant à davantage d’autonomie sont en cours, qui devront aboutir dans les prochains mois à une réforme constitutionnelle. C’est à ce prix que nous combattrons à la fois la défiance et la montée du sentiment d’injustice qui traversent notre pays, et en accroissent les fractures. Les Français ont le sentiment d’un pays à deux vitesses, d’une école à deux vitesses, d’un hôpital à deux vitesses, d’un pays qui n’est plus le même selon l’endroit qu’on habite et selon le milieu d’où on vient.\n\nMonsieur le Premier ministre, votre tâche est ardue, et le contexte difficile. Vous êtes le chef d’orchestre d’une majorité relative. Personne, ni aucun groupe, ne détient la vérité absolue. À vous d’écrire une partition, au nom de l’intérêt général de tous les Français et Françaises, avec écoute et respect pour la diversité politique, qui s’exprime dans cet hémicycle, et qui traduit les fractures de notre pays. _(Applaudissements sur les bancs du groupe HOR.)_\n\nM. Jean-Paul Lecoq\n\nCe n’est pas faute de vous le répéter!\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\nJe dis la même chose!\n\nMme la présidente\n\nLa parole est à Mme Caroline Abadie.\n\nMme Caroline Abadie\n\nSavez-vous ce qui me fascine le plus chez les députés de la NUPES?\n\nM. Boris Vallaud\n\nNon!\n\nMme Raquel Garrido\n\nL’intelligence? _(Sourires.)_\n\nM. Jérôme Guedj\n\nLe talent?\n\nMme Caroline Abadie\n\nEn toutes circonstances, envers et contre tous, ils ont toujours raison. Ils le revendiquent même: ils ne font jamais d’erreur, ils ont toujours raison. _(«Vous parlez des macronistes!»_ _sur les bancs du groupe SOC.)_\n\nPrenons, au hasard, l’exemple de l’agriculture. Ils ont voté contre la loi Egalim du 30 mars 2023. Péremptoires, ils soutenaient l’interdiction immédiate des produits phytosanitaires, ainsi que les délinquants de Sainte-Soline.\n\nM. Robin Reda\n\nEh oui!\n\nM. Philippe Brun\n\nVous parlez du Gouvernement?\n\nMme Caroline Abadie\n\nPuis les tracteurs ont envahi les autoroutes et, soudain, les députés de la NUPES ont affirmé détenir la véritable cause de cette crise: l’excès de normes. Ils n’hésitent plus à réclamer l’application stricte des lois Egalim qu’ils n’ont pas votées. Sitôt les tracteurs retournés aux champs, ils ont encore raison: ils sont les seuls à se soucier de la santé, de l’eau et de la terre –⁠rien que ça! Voilà leur petit monopole pour trois semaines. Quand on a toujours raison, en toutes circonstances, on se débarrasse très vite du souci de cohérence et d’humilité.\n\nMme Raquel Garrido\n\nCelle d’Emmanuel Macron!\n\nMme Caroline Abadie\n\nSuivant la même logique, ils sont persuadés d’avoir eu raison de déposer cette motion de censure –⁠votre première, monsieur le Premier ministre– avant même votre discours de politique générale.\n\nM. Gabriel Attal, Premier ministre\n\nEh oui!\n\nMme Caroline Abadie\n\nCela ne vous aura pas échappé. Ils ont déposé leur motion avant que vous exposiez au Parlement vos priorités: soutenir plus encore les classes moyennes, renforcer l’offre de logements, libérer davantage le travail et l’économie, accélérer la transition écologique.\n\nM. Alexis Corbière\n\nC’est pas terrible. J’ai fait l’effort de rester, mais cela n’en vaut pas la peine. _(M.Alexis Corbière quitte l’hémicycle.)_\n\nMme Caroline Abadie\n\nCependant, même quand on a toujours raison, difficile d’être opposé à la création de 30 000 logements en trois ans, à la création d’un service civique écologique, à la solidarité à la source, ou encore à la baisse des charges pesant sur les classes moyennes!\n\nComme ils savent tout, ils savaient qu’ils seraient opposés à vos priorités avant que vous ne les annonciez. Votre première priorité, la valeur travail, est au cœur de notre projet depuis 2017, de l’apprentissage à la retraite, en passant par la revalorisation de la prime d’activité et du Smic –⁠une augmentation de 11% pour ce dernier. Cela s’accompagne de la diminution du chômage, à son taux le plus bas depuis quarante ans –⁠une diminution de dix points pour les moins de 25 ans depuis qu’Emmanuel Macron a été élu Président de la République. Nous approuvons votre diagnostic. Nous vous soutiendrons pour mettre fin à la trappe aux bas salaires, et garantir aux travailleurs des revenus supérieurs à ceux des personnes qui ne travaillent pas.\n\nS’agissant du besoin d’autorité, vous mettez des mots sur des attentes fortes. Les groupes parlementaires de la majorité n’ont jamais légitimé la violence. La réparation par les casseurs est indispensable. Vous souhaitez apporter une réponse spécifique à la primo-délinquance des moins de 16 ans, découverte pendant les émeutes. Vous pourrez vous appuyer sur la réforme du code de la justice pénale des mineurs –⁠dont on a vu l’efficacité en juillet dernier– pour instaurer les travaux d’intérêt éducatif et responsabiliser les parents.\n\nQuant à la santé, après plusieurs décennies d’austérité, nous avons ouvert les vannes de la formation des médecins, avec +13% de médecins formés depuis 2020. Nous avons refinancé les hôpitaux et revalorisé les soignants.\n\nM. Jérôme Guedj\n\nTout va bien!\n\nMme Caroline Abadie\n\nMais il reste tellement à faire. Monsieur le Premier ministre, vous souhaitez poursuivre la lutte contre les déserts médicaux, en régularisant les médecins étrangers présents en France et en recrutant 10 000 assistants médicaux. Vous entendez faire de la santé mentale une grande cause de l’action gouvernementale, notamment parce que vous reconnaissez l’échec du dispositif Mon soutien psy. Pour la jeunesse en particulier, vous voulez que chaque département dispose d’un service d’accès aux soins. Autant de mesures précieuses pour préserver et améliorer notre système de santé et de solidarité, qui demeure inégalé.\n\nCependant, la NUPES a fait le choix politicien de déposer sa motion de censure avant votre déclaration de politique générale. Relisez sa motion: elle ne contient aucun argument de fond. Ses auteurs désertent le combat des idées, peut-être parce que les quatre composantes de la NUPES ne partagent pas la même vision pour la France.\n\nDès lors, sur quoi cette motion de censure est-elle fondée? Sur le choix des personnes? Sur un commentaire concernant leur propre bilan? Elle ne contient rien à ce sujet, peut-être parce que les quatre composantes de la NUPES ne partagent pas, non plus, la même analyse de notre bilan. Certains, qui étaient au pouvoir il n’y a pas si longtemps, auraient rêvé d’un tel bilan. _(M.Alain David s’exclame.)_ De retour dans l’opposition, ils veulent évidemment plus, plus vite. Ils affirment encore une fois qu’ils ont raison et ils n’ont pas honte de pécher par omission.\n\nAu contraire, nous, Ensemble, partis de la majorité, sommes tous fiers de ce bilan et des ministres qui ont contribué à la création de 90 000 emplois industriels depuis 2017, et à une baisse record des émissions de dioxyde de carbone. Leur rôle a été décisif dans le financement des études sur les voies d’accès à la ligne ferroviaire Lyon-Turin, lors d’une négociation entamée il y a plusieurs mois avec le président de région.\n\nIls ont permis à 35 000 étudiants supplémentaires d’accéder à une bourse, et à 140 000 autres de passer à l’échelon supérieur. Ils ont initié la constitutionnalisation du droit à l’IVG. Ils ont réarmé la France, et l’ont préparée à recevoir le plus grand événement sportif. Nous avons également contribué, au Parlement européen, au plan de relance européen, à la taxation des Gafam, à la taxe carbone aux frontières de l’UE, au pacte sur la migration et l’asile, et bientôt à un «Egalim européen».\n\nEn tant que commissaire aux lois, je suis fière de nos résultats en matière de lutte contre les stupéfiants et de lutte contre les passeurs, et fière du ministre qui les mène sans relâche. Il se bat avec la même ténacité pour une meilleure reconnaissance de l’engagement des sapeurs-pompiers volontaires et pour la revalorisation de leur retraite, ainsi que pour la révision du coût plafond des loyers de gendarmerie.\n\nJe suis également fière du garde des sceaux, qui défend de toutes ses forces le service public de la justice, auquel nous avons alloué des moyens inédits. Je connais bien son combat pour la réinsertion par le travail en prison, contre la surpopulation carcérale et pour des conditions de détention dignes.\n\nNous soutenons également, avec confiance, le ministre de l’agriculture, qui revoit actuellement son projet de loi d’orientation, à l’aune des manifestations récentes.\n\nM. Jean-Paul Lecoq\n\nC’est la remise des prix de fin d’année!\n\nMme Caroline Abadie\n\nIl connaît les enjeux du modèle agricole, qui doit être réinventé dans ses aspects sociaux, fiscaux, et de gouvernance. Il est conscient de l’urgence, particulièrement pour les petits agriculteurs, qu’il convient désormais de mieux écouter. Vous avez ainsi, monsieur le Premier ministre, assumé avec humilité ce qui n’a pas fonctionné avec le GNR.\n\nQu’ils soient reconduits ou nouvellement arrivés, les membres du Gouvernement sont le reflet d’un large éventail de sensibilités, qui ont montré par le passé leur volonté d’agir pour l’intérêt général.\n\nLa seule lutte commune aux députés de la NUPES, décrite dans leur motion de censure, tient à leur acharnement mesquin contre la ministre de l’éducation nationale, de la jeunesse et des sports. Pourtant, elle pourra s’appuyer sur des fondations solides: son propre bilan au ministère des sports, ainsi que le vôtre, monsieur le Premier ministre, à l’éducation nationale. L’école est notre chantier numéro un, avec le dédoublement des classes, la revalorisation des salaires, et la lutte contre le harcèlement. Nous savons que la ministre se battra aux côtés du corps enseignant et sportif, pour notre jeunesse.\n\nM. Emmanuel Pellerin\n\nAbsolument!\n\nMme Caroline Abadie\n\nSi le problème soulevé par la motion de censure ne tient pas au fond ni aux personnes, de quoi s’agit-il? Les députés soutenant cette motion dénoncent un problème de méthode,…\n\nMme Anna Pic\n\nNon, juste de fond!\n\nMme Caroline Abadie\n\n…autrement dit, pour reprendre la formule qu’employait, avec beaucoup d’autodérision, le regretté Chandler Bing: «ce n’est pas ce que tu dis, c’est la façon dont tu le dis»! _(Sourires.)_\n\nM. Robin Reda\n\nEh oui, c’est la chandeleur!\n\nM. Jean-Philippe Tanguy\n\nQuelle citation!\n\nM. Jérôme Guedj\n\nC’est dans _Friends_!\n\nMme Caroline Abadie\n\nLa NUPES souhaitait un vote de confiance. Ils se sont dit: il est jeune, sur un malentendu cela peut marcher, il se soumettra à un vote de confiance. Monsieur le Premier ministre, vous n’êtes pas tombé dans le panneau.\n\nM. Sébastien Jumel\n\n_Singulière jeunesse plurielle_, vous devriez lire ce livre!\n\nMme Caroline Abadie\n\nIls crient au scandale, au déni de démocratie et à la catastrophe, comme toujours. À force, nous devrons bientôt renommer _Pierre et le Loup_: ce sera «Jean-Luc et le loup». Montés sur leurs grands chevaux, ils exhument les archives sur les réseaux sociaux. Ils prétendent qu’on a jamais vu ça depuis 1993. Ils enrobent le tout d’odeur de scandale et crient au déni de démocratie. Dans les commentaires, un courageux écrira qu’en situation de majorité relative, Rocard aussi s’était soustrait au vote de confiance. Les trolls de la NUPES corrigeront alors le factieux qui les contredit –⁠car ce sont eux, souvenez-vous, qui ont toujours raison.\n\nMonsieur le Premier ministre, sur la méthode comme sur le fond, le groupe Renaissance vous fait confiance. Vous souhaitez poursuivre la construction de majorités de projets, comme nous l’avons fait pour les soixante-trois textes adoptés sans recours au 49.3, dans le respect, loin des caricatures.\n\nDepuis sa nomination, le Gouvernement a fait la preuve de sa mobilisation, en discutant avec les forces politiques, avec les organisations syndicales, avec les élus locaux, notamment dans le Pas-de-Calais, à la suite des inondations, et plus récemment avec les agriculteurs. Vous avez démontré qu’il n’y a rien d’impossible à qui veut,…\n\nMme Sophie Taillé-Polian\n\nOh là là!\n\nMme Caroline Abadie\n\n… que des modèles déficitaires, enlisés depuis plusieurs décennies, ne vous font pas peur; que les mots justes, simples et efficaces sont votre vocabulaire;…\n\nM. Jérôme Guedj\n\nN’en jetez plus!\n\nMme Caroline Abadie\n\n…que l’écoute et l’humilité sont vos atouts, avant une puissante mise en action par laquelle vous entraînez administrations et politiques.\n\nM. Sébastien Jumel\n\nSi avec tout ça vous n’êtes pas secrétaire d’État, il faut vous faire rembourser!\n\nMme Caroline Abadie\n\nChers collègues de la NUPES, je sens que vous êtes jaloux, pourtant j’avais dit en préambule que vous aviez toujours raison!\n\nNotre majorité vous accorde donc, monsieur le Premier ministre, toute sa confiance pour atteindre le dernier kilomètre qu’il reste à parcourir, après avoir mené les réformes profondes. Ce bout de chemin est parfois plus difficile, parce qu’il exige une attention aux moindres détails, aux effets de bord, aux décrets d’application, et à tous les Français, partout.\n\nM. Jérôme Guedj\n\nLes CV, c’est par e-mail qu’il faut les envoyer! On sent qu’il reste des places!\n\nMme Caroline Abadie\n\nMonsieur le Premier ministre, c’est votre première motion de censure. Ce ne sera pas la dernière, parce que nous la rejetterons, et parce qu’ils en déposeront d’autres. Ils ont crié au scandale à chaque utilisation du 49.3 par votre prédécesseure, Mme Élisabeth Borne –⁠dont je salue l’action et le courage–, mais ils ne sont pas choqués de déposer des motions à la moindre occasion. Ils furent à peine gênés, lors de l’examen du projet de loi «immigration», en décembre dernier, de leur appel du pied, honteux mais appuyé, à leurs alliés de circonstance, la droite et son extrême. Tout cela pour s’étonner, ensuite, que le Sénat ait eu trop d’influence sur le texte final!\n\nMme Anna Pic\n\nC’est hallucinant!\n\nMme Caroline Abadie\n\nPlus d’une cinquantaine de motions de censure et de motions de rejet préalable ont été déposées. Des centaines de personnes ont été mobilisées, chacune pour des centaines d’heures. Est-ce là ce qu’attendent les Français? Je ne crois pas. Ils attendent et reconnaissent en vous, monsieur le Premier ministre, le courage et la responsabilité nécessaires pour affronter les défis qui se dressent devant nous. Ils attendent non que nous ayons toujours raison, mais que nous ayons, avec sincérité, essayé de résoudre leurs problèmes. Ils veulent simplement que nous soyons à leurs côtés et à leur écoute, pour trouver des solutions. Les Français attendent des actions, et non des motions n’ayant aucun effet sur leur vie.\n\nJ’ai donc l’honneur, chers collègues, au nom du groupe Renaissance, de vous demander de rejeter cette motion de censure qui, en vérité, n’est qu’une nouvelle motion de posture. _(Applaudissements sur les bancs du groupe RE.)_\n\nM. Adrien Quatennens\n\nÇa mérite un secrétariat d’État!\n\nMme la présidente\n\nLa parole est à M.Jean-Philippe Tanguy.\n\nM. Jean-Philippe Tanguy\n\nMonsieur le Premier ministre, les victoires idéologiques du Rassemblement national se suivent et se ressemblent. Face à la mobilisation courageuse des agriculteurs, vous avez dû renier vos programmes d’écologie punitive, votre obsession sadique pour les normes abusives et votre soutien aveugle au libre-échange. Vous avez abandonné, dans vos paroles, les marqueurs du macronisme arrogant qui ruine la France depuis 2017, mais les Français verront vite que vous restez la courroie de transmission servile de la Commission européenne.\n\nMonsieur Attal, avec vous à Matignon, nos victoires idéologiques s’accélèrent.\n\nM. Jérôme Guedj\n\nAh!\n\nM. Jean-Philippe Tanguy\n\nCe ne sont plus seulement nos constats et nos diagnostics qui s’imposent à vous mais, désormais, nos valeurs et nos solutions.\n\nM. Jérôme Guedj\n\nTerrible constat!\n\nM. Jean-Philippe Tanguy\n\nLe précédent plus jeune Premier ministre de l’histoire de notre pays, Laurent Fabius, avait dit à haute voix que le Rassemblement national posait les bonnes questions. Vous voici, monsieur Attal, nouveau benjamin de Matignon, à reconnaître que nos réponses sont tout aussi excellentes.\n\nM. Jérôme Guedj\n\nTerrible!\n\nM. Jean-Philippe Tanguy\n\nHélas, nous le verrons, tous vos actes contredisent –⁠et contrediront– vos paroles. Pour fuir vos responsabilités et vos échecs après sept années au pouvoir, vous pensez pouvoir éviter de dissoudre l’Assemblée nationale en dissolvant le macronisme. Qui eût cru que vous aviez l’âme d’un kamikaze, soldat envoyé à la mort par une caste nihiliste qui se savait déjà perdue!\n\nPourtant, cette ultime tactique du système pour conserver le pouvoir se fracassera vite sur les incohérences d’Emmanuel Macron, faisant hélas perdre un temps précieux à la France et aggravant les difficultés des Français. Les reniements idéologiques confirmés par votre catalogue de politique générale constituent autant de débâcles idéologiques pour la Macronie, de défaites en rase campagne européenne pour les bureaucrates de Bruxelles, d’humiliations pour tous les lâches qui se repaissent de la haine de la France depuis trop d’années.\n\nVotre aveu de défaite représente néanmoins une espérance de victoires pour les Français, avec Marine Le Pen. En effet, les victoires idéologiques précèdent toujours les victoires politiques.\n\nVous nous avez d’abord donné raison sur la réindustrialisation, que vous êtes incapable de mener, puis sur le nucléaire, dont vous vous proclamez le champion après avoir défendu avec la même vigueur la fermeture de la centrale de Fessenheim et le sabotage de l’ensemble de la filière.\n\nComme ministre délégué chargé des comptes publics, vous avez repris nos mots s’agissant du pillage des classes moyennes, avant de les frapper du taux de prélèvements obligatoires le plus élevé de la V e République. De la même manière, vous n’avez pas eu de mots assez forts pour nous rejoindre sur la dérive des finances publiques. Pourtant, le seul budget que vous ayez construit a inclus le déficit budgétaire le plus élevé de notre histoire hors période du covid –⁠170 milliards d’euros–, tout en portant la dette accumulée en sept ans par Emmanuel Macron à 900 milliards d’euros, soit autant qu’entre 1958 et 2001 par les présidents de la République successifs!\n\nComme ministre de l’éducation nationale et de la jeunesse, monsieur Attal, vous vous êtes surpassé. Vous nous avez offert un triomphe intellectuel au sujet de l’école, mettant en avant le besoin d’autorité et les vertus des valeurs républicaines, au premier rang desquelles la laïcité et le combat contre l’islamisme. Certes, toutes vos postures ne visaient qu’à vous attirer les bonnes grâces de l’opinion publique, mais l’humiliation idéologique que la Macronie s’est infligée à elle-même est savoureuse. Vous voilà rendus à expérimenter, en 2024, l’uniforme à l’école dans plusieurs territoires français, vous qui, le 12 janvier 2023, rejetiez, main dans la main avec la NUPES, la proposition de loi du Rassemblement national qui prévoyait cette même mesure. _(Mme Marine Le Pen sourit.)_\n\nDans votre discours du 30 janvier, monsieur le Premier ministre, vous avez confirmé n’être à votre poste que pour combattre le Rassemblement national, seule force politique que vous avez nommément ciblée. Vous aurez donc le sombre destin de tous ceux qui cherchent à prendre les Français pour des imbéciles.\n\nPrésenté comme l’arme redoutable téléguidée par Emmanuel Macron contre Marine Le Pen, le missile «Darmanin» s’est crashé sur l’Élysée. _(Sourires sur les bancs du groupe RN.)_ Il a emporté dans son souffle le pseudo-barrage républicain et toute sa cohorte de socialistes défroqués, rassemblés autour d’Élisabeth Borne, elle-même acculée à avouer, un matin, à ses confesseurs de France Inter que oui, la préférence nationale existe déjà s’agissant du RSA! Cinquante ans de mensonges évanouis en quelques jours!\n\nNon seulement la priorité nationale n’a jamais rien eu d’infamant, mais elle constitue tout simplement le socle de toute République sociale viable, juste et humaniste. Il suffisait d’écouter Jean-Jacques Rousseau s’interroger: «Comment les peuples l’aimeront-ils si la patrie n’est rien de plus pour eux que pour les étrangers?»\n\nM. Boris Vallaud\n\nJaurès, lui, parlait des «maquignons de la patrie»!\n\nM. Jean-Philippe Tanguy\n\nNon content d’avoir démontré que le programme du Rassemblement national est le seul à même de réguler l’immigration et que le barrage républicain n’est qu’une escroquerie, vous avez aussi donné raison à Marine Le Pen sur la nécessité de réaffirmer la souveraineté populaire pour que les paroles politiques soient enfin suivies d’effet.\n\nEn dénaturant gravement l’État de droit en faisant jouer au Conseil constitutionnel un rôle politique contraire à l’esprit et à la lettre de notre République, Emmanuel Macron a justifié qu’il faille consulter nos compatriotes par référendum pour que la volonté populaire s’impose au gouvernement des juges et aux bureaucrates européens. Nous appliquerons un adage simple: celui de la séparation des pouvoirs qui, au sens de Montesquieu, fait du juge «la bouche de la loi» –⁠loi dont le gaullisme de la V e République établit que son meilleur juge, son seul juge suprême est le peuple.\n\nFinalement, monsieur le Premier ministre, votre discours montre qu’après sept années d’échecs, le macronisme est devenu l’hommage de vos vices à nos vertus. Votre vice, c’est de casser; notre vertu, ce sera de réparer. Vous cassez, nous réparerons, car vous êtes incapables d’appliquer au macronisme ce que vous exigez de notre jeunesse.\n\nVous avez cassé notre hôpital public; nous le réparerons. Vous avez cassé l’école du mérite; nous la réparerons. _(M.Boris Vallaud s’exclame.)_ Vous avez cassé notre filière nucléaire; nous la réparerons. Vous avez cassé l’assimilation républicaine; nous la réparerons.\n\nMme Caroline Abadie\n\nVous allez casser le micro!\n\nM. Jean-Philippe Tanguy\n\nVous avez cassé nos frontières; nous les réparerons. Vous avez cassé la politique nataliste du Conseil national de la Résistance (CNR); nous la réparerons. Vous avez cassé la justice fiscale; nous la réparerons.\n\nMme Nadia Hai\n\nC’est trop long!\n\nM. Jean-Philippe Tanguy\n\nVous avez cassé la politique du logement; nous la réparerons. Vous avez cassé notre agriculture; nous la réparerons. Vous avez cassé notre identité; nous la réparerons. Vous avez cassé notre ruralité; nous la réparerons.\n\nMme Nadia Hai\n\nJe vous promets que ça va être trop long pour la capsule! _(Sourires.)_\n\nM. Jean-Philippe Tanguy\n\nVous avez cassé les liens entre les outre-mer et l’Hexagone; nous les réparerons. Vous avez cassé le rêve d’une Europe des peuples; nous le réparerons.\n\nM. Robin Reda\n\nVous allez casser quelque chose!\n\nM. Jean-Philippe Tanguy\n\nBref, vous avez cassé la France; Marine Le Pen la réparera avec tous les Français. _(«Ah!» sur les bancs du groupe RE.)_\n\nMme Caroline Abadie\n\nOn l’avait vu venir!\n\nMme Nadia Hai\n\nAh! Un bon point!\n\nM. Jean-Philippe Tanguy\n\nNotre vertu, c’est le patriotisme; votre vice, outre le brouhaha, c’est le mensonge!\n\nLa semaine dernière, dans votre discours, monsieur le Premier ministre, vous nous avez raillés au motif que nous serions des Cassandre. Mais ignorez-vous que Cassandre avait raison et qu’elle seule aurait pu sauver sa patrie de la destruction si on l’avait écoutée? Nous sommes fiers d’être des Cassandre, car nous savons que le macronisme est le cheval de Troie de tous les maux qui ont affaibli et qui affaibliront la France: le mondialisme, le communautarisme, le nihilisme.\n\nMme Nadia Hai\n\nJ’espère que vous ne réservez pas à la France l’avenir de Cassandre!\n\nM. Jean-Philippe Tanguy\n\nForgé pour tromper les Français, le macronisme n’a été et ne sera qu’une tentative désespérée du système d’unir le pire de la droite et le pire de la gauche pour se maintenir au pouvoir. Ce faisant, vous êtes, sans le savoir, le talon d’Achille d’une oligarchie qui n’aura bientôt plus d’emprise sur la France.\n\nQuand je contemple la débâcle politique de la Macronie et le mal que vous avez fait à la France, je ne peux que penser aux mots prononcés par Philippe Séguin lors de son dernier grand discours de campagne politique.\n\nMme Marie-Agnès Poussier-Winsback\n\nAh non, pitié!\n\nM. Jean-Philippe Tanguy\n\nIl disait que la bonne conscience de gauche allait se lover dans l’argent et qu’elle allait tellement aimer cet argent. Quelle prescience!_(Exclamations sur quelques bancs du groupe RE.)_\n\nMme Constance Le Grip\n\nLaissez les gaullistes tranquilles!\n\nM. Jean-Philippe Tanguy\n\nAlors que les idéaux de la gauche promettaient d’aller à l’assaut du mur de l’argent, elle en est devenue le ciment idéologique, trouvant dans quelques idiots utiles de droite des supplétifs dans sa tâche. Philippe Séguin, que je cite une nouvelle fois, avait annoncé que la gauche «du fric» et la «droite alimentaire» allaient s’allier dans un «monstrueux accouplement». Il ne savait pas que cette coalition serait le macronisme!\n\nM. Nicolas Dupont-Aignan\n\nEh oui!\n\nM. Jean-Philippe Tanguy\n\nToute votre politique consiste à piller les classes moyennes et populaires, les entrepreneurs et les agriculteurs, les travailleurs et les retraités, et ce au seul bénéfice d’une caste de privilégiés qui conduit toute l’économie occidentale dans le mur, particulièrement en France et en Europe.\n\nLa crise de l’agriculture le démontre encore de manière tragique. Alors que nos compatriotes ont massivement soutenu la mobilisation de Françaises et de Français qui veulent enfin pouvoir vivre de leur travail, de leurs terres, de leurs compétences, de la noble mission de nourrir notre peuple, qui veulent faire vivre notre gastronomie, qui veulent perpétuer nos traditions, vous n’avez répondu que par une énième politique du chèque. Évidemment, il n’y a eu aucune remise en cause du pouvoir exorbitant de la grande distribution, des centrales d’achat et du condominium qu’elles forment avec les multinationales de l’agroalimentaire.\n\nAlors que la France traverse la pire crise d’inflation alimentaire que notre peuple ait connue depuis cinquante ans, rarement les agriculteurs n’ont aussi mal vécu de leur travail. Ce paradoxe intolérable montre bien que le sacrifice du pouvoir d’achat des familles ne permet en rien d’améliorer le revenu des paysans, d’autant que, entre-temps, les marges de l’agro-industrie ont bondi à 40 ou 50% –⁠un niveau indigne contre lequel votre gouvernement ne fait rien, sinon mendier des gestes que vous n’obtenez que dans votre imagination.\n\nL’ironie a voulu que les fameuses négociations commerciales entre la grande distribution et l’industrie en vue de faire baisser les prix alimentaires s’achèvent au moment où survenait la crise agricole. Résultat: les prix continueront d’augmenter de 2 à 3% à cause des multinationales…\n\nMme Nadia Hai\n\nOn les incite à partir dans ce cas?\n\nMme Marine Le Pen\n\nArrêtez d’interrompre: c’est insupportable!\n\nM. Jean-Philippe Tanguy\n\n…alors que les TPE –⁠très petites entreprises– et les PME –⁠petites et moyennes entreprises– continueront encore et toujours de faire des efforts. La hausse exorbitante du prix des biens de première nécessité sera donc définitive. Depuis deux ans, vous n’avez fait que balader les Français sur des baisses que vous saviez ne jamais pouvoir obtenir!\n\nMme Nadia Hai\n\nDites-nous comment faire!\n\nMme Marine Le Pen\n\nFerme-la un peu! _(Exclamations sur quelques bancs du groupe RE.)_\n\nMme la présidente\n\nUn peu de silence, chers collègues.\n\nM. Jean-Philippe Tanguy\n\nVous avez couvert la gloutonnerie des multinationales, ces profiteurs de crises qui estiment qu’ils doivent gagner toujours plus d’argent et que les tumultes de nos sociétés ne les concernent que pour trouver des prétextes à spéculer et s’en mettre plein les poches. Vous refusez le rôle d’arbitre que l’État doit jouer pour éliminer les abus ainsi que les ententes, et pour rétablir des relations loyales, mais aussi une économie saine. Vous vous prétendez libéraux, mais vous n’êtes que dans la connivence et la défense des positions dominantes.\n\nMme Nadia Hai\n\nÇa manque de fond et ça vire aux insultes!\n\nM. Jean-Philippe Tanguy\n\nVotre mépris systématique vis-à-vis de la France du travail et de l’entreprenariat est bien visible dans votre politique fiscale qui vise, depuis sept ans, je l’ai dit, à tondre les Françaises et les Français enracinés au profit des nomades et des oligarques, qui disposent comme bon leur semble de leurs capitaux par-delà les frontières.\n\nEn tant que ministre chargé des comptes publics, monsieur Attal, vous aviez annoncé souhaiter un plan Marshall pour les classes moyennes, reconnaissant _de facto_ qu’elles étaient en ruines après cinq ans de guerre menée par Emmanuel Macron contre la France du travail. À ce titre, vous avez ressorti la belle promesse de baisser de 2 milliards d’euros les impôts des classes moyennes d’ici à la Saint-Glinglin, tout en augmentant immédiatement de 4 milliards la taxe sur leur facture d’électricité, avant d’augmenter de 10% celle sur le gaz à compter du 1 er juillet.\n\nM. Philippe Ballard\n\nEh oui!\n\nM. Jean-Philippe Tanguy\n\nCe mépris pour la France du travail est la raison pour laquelle vous êtes si intimement liés à l’idéologie mondialiste et aux traités de libre-échange, que vous signez au mépris de l’intérêt des Français, mais aussi au mépris même de l’écologie que vous ne défendez que lorsque cela vous donne un prétexte pour taxer nos compatriotes et leur imposer je ne sais quelle norme dont vous exemptez pourtant nos concurrents. À cet égard, monsieur le Premier ministre, je vous félicite d’avoir supprimé dix normes dans le domaine de l’agriculture: sachez qu’il en reste 399 990! _(Mme Marine Le Pen sourit.)_\n\nVos déclarations sur les traités de libre-échange en général et sur celui que nous envisageons avec le Mercosur en particulier relèvent tout simplement de l’escroquerie politique. Vous mentez éhontément aux Français quand vous prétendez vous opposer au mondialisme ou défendre une exception agriculturelle. Si nos paysans n’avaient pas manifesté, vous auriez continué à laisser filer les négociations avec le Mercosur, tout comme vous avez laissé aboutir, dès que les médias ont eu le dos tourné, les traités avec la Nouvelle-Zélande, le Chili ou le Kenya. À ce titre, où en est le vote du Parlement sur le Ceta –⁠Accord économique et commercial global? Voici bientôt sept ans, je dis bien sept ans, que le Sénat français est privé de vote et que cet accord s’applique au mépris de la souveraineté française.\n\nM. Nicolas Dupont-Aignan\n\nTout à fait!\n\nM. Jean-Philippe Tanguy\n\nCette situation ubuesque montre bien que votre propagande au sujet d’une souveraineté européenne n’est rien d’autre qu’un mensonge d’État.\n\nUne nation est souveraine ou ne l’est pas: elle ne «l’est jamais à demi», comme le notait encore Philippe Séguin. Si la Commission européenne est souveraine pour négocier des accords commerciaux, alors la France ne peut s’y opposer. Et si la France a le droit souverain de s’y opposer, alors la Commission européenne n’est plus souveraine.\n\nMonsieur le Premier ministre, la dernière fois que je vous ai interpellé depuis cette tribune, je vous ai comparé à Bonaparte, que Pie VII qualifiait de tragédien, de comédien. Vous pardonnerez mon manque de modestie en constatant que j’avais démasqué votre talent pour incarner tout et son contraire. Votre carrière est comme celle d’Emmanuel Macron: elle repose sur une véritable pyramide de Ponzi; sur une manipulation qui consiste à convaincre un maximum de gens de vous accorder leur confiance avant que d’aucuns se rendent compte que vous ne savez absolument pas où vous les menez.\n\nNous ne vous ferons pas le plaisir de vous censurer. Cela vous permettrait de feindre d’affronter des oppositions stériles.\n\nM. Adrien Quatennens\n\nIls vous remercient!\n\nM. Jean-Philippe Tanguy\n\nLa NUPES jouera parfaitement ce rôle d’opposant fantoche, elle qui, par deux fois, a cocufié ses électeurs en vous offrant le pouvoir. Arrivera bien assez vite le moment où vos actes trahiront votre vraie nature d’avatar d’Emmanuel Macron.\n\nMme Nadia Hai\n\nC’est décevant! Cela manque de fond!\n\nM. Jean-Philippe Tanguy\n\nCe jour-là, ni vos comédies, ni vos tragédies ne vous sauveront. Ce jour-là, monsieur le Premier ministre, nous vous censurerons. Car n’est pas Bonaparte qui veut,…\n\nMme Constance Le Grip\n\nN’est pas Philippe Séguin qui veut non plus!\n\nM. Jean-Philippe Tanguy\n\n…et comme le consul le disait lui-même: «Du sublime au ridicule, il n’y a qu’un pas.» Quand Jupiter vous retirera ses faveurs, la roche Tarpéienne sera si proche du Capitole! _(Applaudissements sur les bancs du groupe RN.)_\n\nMme Nadia Hai\n\nC’est tout? C’est décevant! Vous nous avez habitués à plus de fond!\n\nMme Marine Le Pen\n\nNe parlez pas de fond!\n\nMme Nadia Hai\n\nChez vous, c’est vide!\n\nMme la présidente\n\nChers collègues, s’il vous plaît.\n\nLa parole est à M.Nicolas Dupont-Aignan.\n\nMme Nadia Hai\n\nAh! C’est sûr, le niveau va monter!\n\nM. Nicolas Dupont-Aignan\n\nVous n’avez pas osé accompagner votre déclaration de politique générale d’un vote de confiance, comme il est de tradition, car vous savez que vous êtes minoritaires…\n\nM. Robin Reda\n\nMinoritaires, mais pas seuls!\n\nM. Nicolas Dupont-Aignan\n\n…dans cette assemblée, comme dans le pays. Ainsi, pour mettre chaque député devant ses responsabilités, cette motion de censure est la bienvenue. Je la voterai évidemment, et ce pour trois raisons fondamentales.\n\nPremièrement, vous accorder un sursis ferait de nous, députés de la nation, les complices de la pure opération de communication qu’a constituée votre nomination à Matignon. En effet, qui peut croire un instant que vous allez changer de politique? Il suffisait d’écouter avec attention, mardi, votre déclaration de politique générale –⁠un catalogue de mesurettes avec tant de priorités qu’il n’y en a plus aucune– pour comprendre combien vous étiez la voix de votre maître.\n\nNe pas voter la censure reviendrait concrètement à faire souffrir davantage les Français et à faire perdre encore plus de temps à la France. Doublement des franchises médicales, explosion des tarifs de l’électricité et du gaz, appauvrissement sans précédent des chômeurs de longue durée –⁠tout en régularisant une main-d’œuvre bon marché–, hausse du tarif des autoroutes, réduction de trois ans à six mois du congé parental… Et vous osez affirmer que voulez défendre les classes moyennes?\n\nVous n’avez que le mot «autorité» à la bouche, mais vous ne voulez pas vous attaquer aux causes profondes de l’explosion de la délinquance: le laxisme judiciaire, l’ouverture des frontières et la soumission à un droit européen qui explique l’impuissance généralisée de l’État.\n\nPlus grave encore, ne pas voter la censure reviendrait à cautionner le vrai cap d’Emmanuel Macron et de votre Gouvernement: la dissolution de la France dans une Union européenne de plus en plus inefficace et autoritaire.\n\nContrairement à ce que vous avez voulu nous faire croire dans votre discours de mardi dernier pour endormir les Français face au saut fédéral que vous préparez, il n’est pas possible de courir deux lièvres à la fois: celui de la souveraineté française et celui de la souveraineté européenne. Ainsi, votre promesse, à Paris, de bloquer l’accord de libre-échange entre l’Union européenne et le Mercosur, suivie des déclarations de la Commission européenne, qui annonce vouloir le signer au plus vite, révèle votre double jeu total.\n\nDerrière les grandes envolées lyriques, nous assistons à un véritable hold-up intellectuel visant à cacher un transfert historique de compétences et de pouvoirs à l’échelon supranational, comme en témoigne la révision des traités en préparation. Philippe Séguin l’avait d’ailleurs tout résumé: «Par essence, la souveraineté est un absolu qui exclut toute idée de subordination et de compromission. Un peuple souverain n’a de comptes à rendre à personne.»\n\nEnfin, je voterai la motion de censure (_«Ah!» sur plusieurs bancs du groupe RE_) car je ne peux pas cautionner ici les errements d’Emmanuel Macron et de votre Gouvernement en matière de politique étrangère et de défense. La déclaration hallucinante du Président de la République à Stockholm bradant, dans la confusion la plus totale –⁠en langue anglaise, de surcroît–, notre force de dissuasion nucléaire nationale à nos voisins européens, rompt avec les décennies de clarté et de cohérence de ses prédécesseurs.\n\nMme Constance Le Grip\n\nC’est faux! Vous n’avez pas écouté!\n\nM. Nicolas Dupont-Aignan\n\nNotre dissuasion nucléaire n’a de sens et n’est dimensionnée que pour sanctuariser notre territoire national et empêcher le franchissement de ses frontières.\n\nMme Nadia Hai\n\nEt on va aussi dresser des murs comme Trump?\n\nM. Nicolas Dupont-Aignan\n\nL’étendre avec inconscience au théâtre européen, menacé par l’extension de la guerre en Ukraine, revient à transformer cette force nucléaire stratégique en un outil tactique pouvant déclencher une escalade nucléaire et sacrifier les Français pour une guerre qu’ils n’auraient pas voulue.\n\nMme Constance Le Grip\n\nC’est faux!\n\nM. Nicolas Dupont-Aignan\n\nC’est entièrement juste! Relisez ce qu’a dit le Président de la République!\n\nMme Constance Le Grip\n\nVous n’avez pas écouté. Jacques Chirac, Nicolas Sarkozy et François Hollande avaient dit la même chose!\n\nM. Nicolas Dupont-Aignan\n\nIl est à cet égard inconcevable que notre Parlement ne se soit pas réuni, en application de l’article 35 de la Constitution, compte tenu de la fuite en avant et des livraisons d’armes toujours plus importantes d’Emmanuel Macron, obéissant servilement à l’Union européenne et à l’Otan.\n\nSur la scène internationale, la France n’est plus que l’ombre d’elle-même. Elle n’incarne plus une voix libre, capable de défendre un plan de paix équilibré. L’heure est grave, les Français nous regardent. Pour ma part, je ne cautionnerai jamais la dérive actuelle. Seule une censure, suivie d’une dissolution et de l’arbitrage du peuple, peut enrayer l’effondrement du pays. Tout le reste n’est que bavardage dilatoire.\n\nMme Nadia Hai\n\nVous dites cela parce que nous n’avons pas voté votre amendement à 2%!\n\nM. Jérôme Guedj\n\nIl n’y a pas de réponse?\n\nMme la présidente\n\nLa discussion est close.\n\n Je vais maintenant mettre aux voix la motion de censure.\n\nLe scrutin est annoncé dans l’enceinte de l’Assemblée nationale.\n\nJe rappelle que seuls les députés favorables à la motion de censure participent au scrutin et que le vote se déroule dans les salles voisines de l’hémicycle.\n\nLe scrutin est ouvert pour vingt minutes. Il sera clos à douze heures huit.\n\n_Suspension et reprise de la séance_\n\nMme la présidente\n\nLa séance est suspendue.\n\n_(La séance, suspendue à onze heures quarante-huit, est reprise à douze heures neuf.)_\n\nMme la présidente\n\nLa séance est reprise.\n\nVoici le résultat du scrutin:\n\nMajorité requise pour l’adoption de la motion de censure, soit la majorité absolue des membres composant l’Assemblée 289\n\nPour l’adoption 124\n\nLa majorité requise n’étant pas atteinte, la motion de censure n’est pas adoptée.\n\n2.Ordre du jour de la prochaine séance\n--------------------------------------\n\nMme la présidente\n\nProchaine séance, demain, à quinze heures:\n\nQuestions au Gouvernement;\n\n Discussion, en lecture définitive, de la proposition de loi visant à garantir le respect du droit à l’image des enfants;\n\n Discussion de la proposition de loi, adoptée par le Sénat, renforçant la sécurité des élus locaux et la protection des maires.\n\nLa séance est levée.\n\n_(La séance est levée à douze heures dix.)_\n\n_Le directeur des comptes rendus_\n\n_Serge Ezdra_",

        "full_text_segment": "Mme Anne Bouverot. – Nous avons formulé 25 recommandations. Je reviendrai sur 7 d’entre elles, qui nous paraissent particulièrement importantes.\n\n La première serait de créer les conditions d’une appropriation collective de l’IA, en lançant un plan de sensibilisation et de formation à l’échelle de la nation. Dans le cadre de la révolution de l’IA, au‑delà des métiers à risque et des métiers à créer, beaucoup de tâches et de métiers sont appelés à se transformer. Il conviendra donc d’agir sur la formation continue. Il faudra également former davantage de personnes à l’IA dans le cadre de la formation initiale, en veillant à associer l’IA aux grands domaines de formation : droit, histoire, finance, etc. Nous aurons également besoin d’un plan de sensibilisation de tous les citoyens et tous les élèves, dès l’école maternelle, à la compréhension des enjeux de l’IA, par exemple pour développer chez eux un esprit critique face aux images générées par l’IA, dans une optique de lutte contre la désinformation.\n\n La deuxième recommandation serait d’investir massivement dans les entreprises du numérique et dans la transformation des entreprises, quelle que soit leur taille, pour soutenir l’écosystème français et préserver sa compétitivité. Pour ce faire, la proposition serait de créer un fonds dédié « France et IA ».\n\n La troisième recommandation serait de faire de la France et de l’Europe un pôle majeur de la puissance de calcul, à court et à moyen termes. L’IA et les grands modèles de langage reposent sur énormément de puissance de calcul et de données. Le sujet de la puissance de calcul est donc fondamental.\n\n La quatrième recommandation serait de transformer notre approche de la donnée personnelle, pour pouvoir à la fois continuer à protéger nos concitoyens, en confortant le rôle de la Cnil et du RGPD, tout en étant capables de soutenir l’innovation au bénéfice de tous, dans le domaine de la santé notamment.\n\n La cinquième recommandation serait, dans le cadre du développement de l’IA dans le domaine de la culture et des industries créatives, d’assurer le rayonnement de la culture française, pour éviter que les modèles d’IA soient entraînés principalement sur des données et de la culture anglo-saxonnes. À cet égard, les données de l’Institut national de l’audiovisuel (INA) représentent déjà 100 fois plus que les données du common crawl utilisé pour l’entraînement des modèles et résultant du balayage de l’internet. Ces données ont une valeur quantitative et qualitative importante, qu’il faut mobiliser.\n\n La sixième recommandation serait de conduire une expérimentation dans le domaine de la recherche publique autour de l’IA, pour améliorer les conditions de travail de nos chercheurs et éviter une fuite de nos talents, notamment vers les grandes entreprises américaines, celles‑ci offrant aujourd’hui des conditions de travail et de rémunération incomparables.\n\n Enfin, la septième recommandation serait de structurer une initiative diplomatique internationale cohérente pour promouvoir une gouvernance mondiale de l’IA. À cet égard, l’accueil par la France du prochain sommet mondial de l’IA pourrait représenter une opportunité.\n\n Au‑delà de ces recommandations, nous sommes convaincus que notre capacité à nous différencier dans le domaine de l’IA dépendra de notre capacité à prendre aussi en compte les enjeux environnementaux associés."

L’espoir est que l’IA nous permette enfin de sortir d’une croissance atone.\n\n La crainte d’une IA génératrice de chômage et d’inégalités vient du constat d’une utilisation possible de l’IA pour automatiser, en partie ou totalement, la production d’un certain nombre de tâches, parfois de manière totalement inédite (conduite de véhicules, génération d’images, synthèse de notes et de sujets, traduction, doublage de films, etc.). Cette automatisation semble pouvoir concerner beaucoup d’emplois existants.\n\n L’espoir est que l’IA permette non seulement d’automatiser en partie la production de biens et de services, comme l’ont fait avant elle les moteurs à combustion, l’électricité et les semi‑conducteurs, mais permette aussi d’automatiser un certain nombre de tâches utilisées dans la production d’idées, pour améliorer et accélérer l’innovation et la recherche. L’IA facilite l’imitation et l’apprentissage. Elle peut s’auto-améliorer et permet de traiter des problèmes complexes. Elle représente donc un outil extraordinaire de recherche, avec des opportunités de croissance associées.\n\n Dans notre rapport, nous avons considéré que l’IA ne devait susciter ni excès de pessimisme, ni excès d’optimisme. Nous n’avons ainsi anticipé ni chômage de masse, ni accélération automatique de la croissance.\n\n Pour mesurer l’impact de l’IA sur l’emploi, nous avons réalisé une étude inédite, sur un large échantillon d’entreprises françaises fourni par l’Insee. Avec un recul de 3 ou 4 ans, cette étude a mis en évidence que, globalement, les entreprises ayant adopté l’IA étaient créatrices nettes d’emplois. L’effet de productivité généré par l’IA, améliorant la compétitivité et accélérant le développement des entreprises, est ainsi apparu l’emporter sur l’effet de substitution à la force de travail.\n\n Cet effet globalement positif est apparu masquer des disparités en fonction des métiers. Les entreprises ayant adopté l’IA pour la gestion administrative ou le marketing ont notamment semblé voir leurs emplois dans ces domaines diminuer. Dans les professions intermédiaires, administratives ou commerciales, des emplois seront menacés par l’automatisation permise par l’IA. Une politique d’adaptation du marché du travail et de formation sera donc nécessaire.\n\n Vis‑à‑vis de la croissance, en se référant à l’élan donné par les révolutions technologiques précédentes, liées à l’électricité ou aux technologies de l’information et de la communication (TIC), on pourrait anticiper une hausse du taux de croissance de l’ordre de 1 % par an sur 10 ans. Certains diront qu’en prenant aussi en compte l’automatisation de la production des idées, un potentiel plus élevé de croissance pourrait être envisagé. D’autres diront au contraire qu’il conviendrait également de prendre en compte un certain nombre de freins et d’obstacles à la croissance, liés notamment à l’absence de concurrence dans les segments en amont de la chaîne de production de l’IA que sont l’accès aux données et l’accès à la puissance de calcul. La révolution des TIC, par exemple, a dopé la croissance aux États‑Unis à la fin des années 1990\\. Cependant, une période de stagnation a ensuite été observée, résultant de l’essor de grands groupes, les GAFAM, ayant fini par inhiber l’entrée sur le marché d’entreprises innovantes. Dans le domaine de l’IA, de grands acteurs, dont les GAFAM, sont déjà présents. Si nous n’adaptons pas notre politique de concurrence, nous risquons d’être confrontés à des obstacles à la croissance.\n\n L’IA représente ainsi un grand potentiel de croissance et de création d’emplois. Pour exploiter ce potentiel et faire pleinement de l’IA un facteur de progrès, il nous faudra toutefois réformer nos institutions et nos politiques publiques, en matière d’éducation, de concurrence, d’adaptation du marché du travail, etc."

À cet égard, les données de l’Institut national de l’audiovisuel (INA) représentent déjà 100 fois plus que les données du common crawl utilisé pour l’entraînement des modèles et résultant du balayage de l’internet. Ces données ont une valeur quantitative et qualitative importante, qu’il faut mobiliser.\n\n La sixième recommandation serait de conduire une expérimentation dans le domaine de la recherche publique autour de l’IA, pour améliorer les conditions de travail de nos chercheurs et éviter une fuite de nos talents, notamment vers les grandes entreprises américaines, celles‑ci offrant aujourd’hui des conditions de travail et de rémunération incomparables.\n\n Enfin, la septième recommandation serait de structurer une initiative diplomatique internationale cohérente pour promouvoir une gouvernance mondiale de l’IA. À cet égard, l’accueil par la France du prochain sommet mondial de l’IA pourrait représenter une opportunité.\n\n Au‑delà de ces recommandations, nous sommes convaincus que notre capacité à nous différencier dans le domaine de l’IA dépendra de notre capacité à prendre aussi en compte les enjeux environnementaux associés. Il nous faudra faire preuve de transparence vis‑à‑vis des impacts environnementaux de l’IA et favoriser le développement de solutions et de modèles d’IA portant une attention spécifique à ces enjeux : consommation énergétique, consommation d’eau, frugalité, etc.\n\nM. David Ros, sénateur, vice-président de l’Office. – J’ai eu l’occasion de demander au Gouvernement si les hauts fonctionnaires de Bercy avaient utilisé l’IA pour mesurer l’impact dans la durée des coupes budgétaires annoncées, dans la recherche et l’enseignement supérieur notamment – les investissements dans ce domaine rejoignant les dépenses vertueuses évoquées par Philippe Aghion. Je n’ai toutefois pas obtenu de réponse.\n\n Vous avez par ailleurs évoqué le retard en investissements dans l’IA de la France par rapport aux États‑Unis, en pourcentage du PIB. Pourriez‑vous cependant détailler ce retard en distinguant l’investissement public de l’investissement privé ?\n\n Se pose par ailleurs la question du bénéfice de la croissance générée par l’IA. Où en est‑on des réflexions sur la rétribution de ceux qui participent à cette croissance par leurs données, au‑delà des questions déontologiques, ou par la mise à disposition de leur puissance de calcul ? Ceci pose également, en toile de fond, la question de la souveraineté numérique de la France et de l’Europe.\n\nMme Sonia de La Provôté, sénatrice. – Un rapport récent de l’Académie nationale de médecine a soulevé un enjeu de supervision humaine de l’usage de l’IA dans le domaine de la santé. Dans votre rapport, cette dimension de protection semble constituer un frein. Toutefois, ce frein sera d’autant moins important que nous l’anticiperons, tant sur le plan éthique que sur le plan juridique, en considérant les enjeux liés à la protection des patients, à la responsabilité du corps médical, à la formation des professionnels de santé, etc.\n\n Dans le domaine de la culture, au‑delà de la langue d’expression des modèles d’IA, il nous faudra aussi considérer la protection de notre terreau culturel, de notre histoire culturelle, de nos manières de penser et de nos artistes auteurs. L’IA progressant très rapidement dans le domaine de la culture, il nous faudra considérer les gains économiques associés, mais aussi les pertes économiques, culturelles et démocratiques à prévenir pour nos concitoyens. Il y a aujourd’hui une forme d’urgence à traiter ces questions.\n\nM. Alexandre Sabatou, député. – Vous avez salué dans votre rapport une augmentation, en France, des investissements en capital-risque dans l’IA. Cependant, ceux‑ci demeurent très faibles par rapport à ceux observés aux États‑Unis. Comment encourager l’investissement à long terme dans les entreprises françaises, au‑delà de l’investissement public qui ne peut répondre seul aux enjeux soulevés par l’IA ?\n\n Par ailleurs, l’investissement public que vous préconisez, à hauteur de 25 milliards d’euros sur 5 ans, sera‑t‑il suffisant pour lutter contre la domination des GAFAM – la société OpenAI étant aujourd’hui valorisée à plus de 100 milliards d’euros ?\n\n Enfin, votre rapport met l’accent sur la souveraineté européenne. La France apparaît certes petite pour rivaliser avec les GAFAM, les États‑Unis ou la Chine. Avez‑vous néanmoins identifié des limites dans cette coopération entre les États à l’échelle européenne ? Certaines dimensions ne devraient‑elles pas demeurer franco-françaises, autour de la gestion des données notamment ?\n\nMme Anne Bouverot. – Nous accusons, de fait, un retard par rapport aux États‑Unis dans les investissements dans l’IA, tant sur le volet public que sur le volet privé. Les stratégies recommandées par le rapport Villani de 2018 et mises en œuvre via France 2030 ont consisté à investir 3 milliards d’euros sur 8 ans. L’investissement public à hauteur de 5 milliards d’euros par an sur 5 ans que nous recommandons serait donc significatif. En parallèle, nous recommandons la constitution d’un fonds « France et IA », doté d’une gouvernance publique-privée, pour encourager aussi l’investissement privé. Aux États‑Unis, la recherche publique est ainsi achetée par les entreprises privées. La chercheuse Fei‑Fei Li a récemment interpellé Joe Biden à ce sujet à l’occasion de son discours sur l’état de l’Union.\n\n Dans le domaine de la santé, la protection des données demeure effectivement extrêmement importante. La proposition serait de conserver le rôle de la Cnil dans cette protection, tout en lui confiant, avec des ressources supplémentaires, un rôle dans le domaine de l’innovation. La Cnil, que nous avons auditionnée, est appelée à répondre à de plus en plus de questions autour de l’IA. Elle aura donc un rôle extrêmement important à jouer, y compris pour donner de la visibilité en amont aux entreprises et aux organisations, pour qu’elles puissent innover et déployer leurs services liés à l’IA en anticipant les éventuelles difficultés associées. Concrètement, dans le domaine de la santé, une autorisation préalable est aujourd’hui obligatoire pour l’utilisation de données dans une optique de recherche et de développement de solutions au bénéfice des patients. Nous estimons que cette autorisation préalable pourrait être supprimée, au profit d’une logique de responsabilisation des acteurs et de validation ex post. À défaut, le risque serait que ces solutions continuent d’être développées par d’autres et que nous soyons amenés, pour répondre à des enjeux de santé, à retenir des innovations ne provenant majoritairement pas d’acteurs français."

Stéphane Piednoir, sénateur, président de l’Office, et \n\nMme Christine Lavarde, sénateur, présidente de la délégation sénatoriale à la prospective – \n\nLa réunion est ouverte à 18 h 00. \n\nAudition de Philippe Aghion et Anne Bouverot, co-présidents de la Commission de l’intelligence artificielle, sur les conclusions de leur rapport « IA : notre ambition pour la France » \n\nMme Christine Lavarde, sénateur, présidente de la délégation à la prospective. – Monsieur le président de l’Office parlementaire d’évaluation des choix scientifiques et technologiques (OPECST), Madame et Monsieur les co‑présidents de la Commission de l’intelligence artificielle, chers collègues députés et sénateurs, avec l’apparition de ChatGPT il y a un an et demi, le grand public a pris conscience de ce que les spécialistes savaient et disaient déjà : l’intelligence artificielle (IA) est une rupture technologique majeure, une innovation qui pourrait bouleverser tous les secteurs, comparable en cela à la machine à vapeur, à l’électricité ou à l’internet, et avec l’IA générative et les grands modèles de langage, cette révolution vient de s’accélérer.\n\n L’OPECST et la délégation sénatoriale à la prospective, à travers leurs travaux, ont également pris conscience de cette accélération inévitable.\n\n Nous sommes aujourd’hui réunis pour entendre Philippe Aghion, économiste de l’innovation, et Anne Bouverot, présidente du conseil d’administration de l’École normale supérieure, nous présenter les conclusions du rapport établi par la Commission de l’intelligence artificielle, installée en septembre 2023 par la Première ministre de l’époque.\n\n Ce rapport a été remis au Président de la République il y a deux semaines. Nous sommes très fiers que vous puissiez aujourd’hui en faire la présentation devant les parlementaires, dans le cadre de cette audition publique.\n\n Ce rapport était très attendu par de nombreux acteurs. Il a par exemple été discuté ce matin par la REF Numérique du Medef, qui a notamment relevé le montant des investissements recommandés pour permettre à la France de prendre le tournant de l’IA. Nous pourrons évoquer ensemble ce sujet, qui soulève également des enjeux de soutenabilité des finances publiques.\n\n La délégation sénatoriale à la prospective, qui n’a pas d’équivalent à l’Assemblée nationale, a fait collectivement le choix de s’intéresser plus particulièrement cette année aux usages de l’IA et notamment à la manière dont elle pourrait transformer le service public. Dans cette optique, nous avons déjà auditionné le co‑président du Conseil national du numérique, Gilles Babinet.\n\n Nous sommes convaincus que l’IA peut rendre le service public plus efficace, mais aussi plus humain. À la lecture de votre rapport, il apparaît cependant qu’il faudra « accélérer, amplifier, généraliser et décliner par service public la mobilisation des administrations publiques autour de l’IA ».\n\n La délégation a, elle aussi, retenu cette approche thématique. Le premier rapport de notre série sur l’IA portera sur les impôts, les prestations sociales et la lutte contre la fraude. Il sera présenté la semaine prochaine par Sylvie Vermeillet et Didier Rambaud. D’autres rapports suivront sur les enjeux de l’IA vis‑à‑vis de la santé, de l’éducation, de l’environnement et des territoires.\n\n Ces réflexions permettront de développer une approche transversale, en mobilisant différentes instances du Sénat. Le Groupe d’amitié France-États‑Unis procède, en ce moment même, à une audition sur le sujet. Pascale Gruny et Ghislaine Senée sont également présentes parmi nous ce jour pour la délégation sénatoriale aux collectivités territoriales.\n\n Aujourd’hui, nous souhaiterions connaitre votre vision d’ensemble des enjeux liés à l’IA, vous qui estimez nécessaire de « relever le défi de l’IA », sous peine de perdre la « maîtrise de notre avenir », et appelez de vos vœux « une mobilisation collective, massive, sans délai et au long cours ». Comment faire et par où commencer ? Nous vous interrogerons également sur les enjeux financiers associés, ainsi que sur les enjeux liés aux données, avec en point de mire la question du rôle de la Cnil.\n\nM. Stéphane Piednoir, sénateur, président de l’Office. – Madame la présidente de la délégation à la prospective, Madame et Monsieur les co‑présidents de la Commission de l’intelligence artificielle, chers collègues députés et sénateurs, pour relever le défi de l’IA, il conviendra de faire des choix. Faudra‑t‑il développer des modèles ouverts ou bien fermés ? La régulation mise en œuvre devra‑t‑elle porter sur la technologie ou bien sur les usages de l’IA ? La France aura‑t‑elle besoin de sa propre infrastructure de calcul ou pourra‑t‑elle s’appuyer sur une offre privée, éventuellement étrangère ?\n\n Ces choix avant tout technologiques ont conduit l’OPECST, présidé en alternance par un député ou un sénateur, à s’intéresser au sujet. En effet, les décisions politiques appelées à forger notre avenir dépendent fortement de notre capacité à saisir les possibilités et les limites de chacune des technologies, dans le domaine de l’IA comme dans celui de l’énergie.\n\n L’OPECST a déjà publié plusieurs travaux sur le thème de l’IA. C’est d’ailleurs à un ancien président de l’Office, Cédric Villani, que nous devons la première formulation, dès 2018, de notre stratégie nationale en matière d’IA. Aujourd’hui, l’accélération spectaculaire du développement de l’IA, avec l’essor de l’IA générative, la diffusion massive de la technologie, l’augmentation de la consommation énergétique associée et un afflux sans précédent de capitaux, nous impose d’adapter cette stratégie. Tel est précisément le mandat confié par le Gouvernement à la Commission de l’intelligence artificielle.\n\n Pour adapter notre stratégie, il nous faudra prendre toute la mesure des technologies de l’IA, d’où la saisine de l’OPECST par les bureaux de l’Assemblée nationale et du Sénat. Nos rapporteurs Huguette Tiegna, Alexandre Sabatou, Corinne Narassiguin et Patrick Chaize y travaillent.\n\n Notre démarche sera complémentaire à celle de la délégation sénatoriale à la prospective. L’un des enjeux majeurs que nous partagerons sera celui de la sensibilisation de nos concitoyens, pour éviter les fantasmes autour de l’IA – certains voyant dans l’IA un risque de chômage de masse et de remplacement des humains ; d’autres y voyant au contraire un remède miracle et la source d’une croissance magique. Il nous faudra promouvoir la connaissance de l’IA, pour être moins dans la science-fiction et davantage dans l’action.\n\nMme Anne Bouverot, co-présidente de la Commission de l’intelligence artificielle. – Mesdames et Messieurs les députés et sénateurs, la Commission de l’intelligence artificielle a été constituée, en septembre 2023, de 15 experts, assistés de 15 rapporteurs. Dans le cadre de nos travaux, nous avons auditionné plus de 600 personnes. Nous avons mené une consultation nationale grâce à l’application Agora, auprès d’environ 7 000 personnes. Nous avons également échangé dans le cadre de réunions plénières, tous les vendredis au Collège de France. Je salue l’engagement très fort de toutes les personnes ayant contribué à ce travail collectif.\n\n À partir de cette matière, notre rapport a été conçu pour être à la fois pédagogique, didactique et consommable de différentes manières, avec un résumé, des chapitres consacrés aux différents sujets d’intérêt – l’éducation, la culture, la puissance de calcul, etc. – et un ensemble de recommandations.\n\n Vous l’avez souligné, l’IA est une révolution technologique, qui progresse à une vitesse sans précédent. Il a fallu 5 jours à ChatGPT pour obtenir 1 million d’utilisateurs. Or il avait fallu 2,5 mois à Instagram et 3,5 ans à Netflix pour obtenir le même nombre d’utilisateurs. Ce développement rapide nous impose de réagir rapidement.\n\n Le rapport produit en 2018 par Cédric Villani était d’une excellente qualité. Nous avons d’ailleurs échangé avec lui dans le cadre de nos travaux. Cependant, nous sommes désormais appelés à franchir une autre étape. Nous pensons qu’il faudra pour cela aller plus vite et investir davantage.\n\n Dans cette révolution extrêmement rapide et sans précédent, la France et l’Europe ne font pas la course en tête. Les États‑Unis ont d’ores et déjà une économie du numérique deux à trois fois plus importante. La Chine met en œuvre des plans d’investissement massifs et à long terme. L’Arabie saoudite vient d’annoncer un projet d’investissement de 40 milliards dans le domaine de l’IA. Des initiatives significatives, privées et publiques, sont ainsi lancées à travers le monde.\n\n Comme toute technologie, l’IA est porteuse de risques, sociétaux et environnementaux notamment. Il semble donc important de nous pencher dès à présent sur ces risques, pour pouvoir les maîtriser collectivement. Vis‑à‑vis des réseaux sociaux, nous n’avons pris conscience que tardivement de certains risques. L’enjeu est d’éviter de reproduire ce schéma avec l’IA.\n\n En parallèle, l’IA est également une source d’opportunités, que nous nous sommes efforcés de mettre en évidence, avec un optimisme raisonné. Il y a là pour la France un véritable potentiel de croissance, de création d’emplois et de bénéfices sociaux et sociétaux.\n\n Avant de présenter nos recommandations, je laisserai le soin à Philippe Aghion de détailler le travail réalisé par notre commission, au travers d’études inédites et très éclairantes, sur l’impact économique et sur le travail de l’IA.\n\nM. Philippe Aghion, co-président de la Commission de l’intelligence artificielle. – La révolution de l’IA, et son accélération avec le développement de l’IA générative, suscitent à la fois de la crainte et de l’espoir. La crainte est que cette révolution détruise massivement des emplois, en rendant l’humain redondant dans un nombre sans cesse plus grand de tâches, et concentre le pouvoir et les richesses dans quelques mains. L’espoir est que l’IA nous permette enfin de sortir d’une croissance atone.\n\n La crainte d’une IA génératrice de chômage et d’inégalités vient du constat d’une utilisation possible de l’IA pour automatiser, en partie ou totalement, la production d’un certain nombre de tâches, parfois de manière totalement inédite (conduite de véhicules, génération d’images, synthèse de notes et de sujets, traduction, doublage de films, etc.).

L’effet de productivité généré par l’IA, améliorant la compétitivité et accélérant le développement des entreprises, est ainsi apparu l’emporter sur l’effet de substitution à la force de travail.\n\n Cet effet globalement positif est apparu masquer des disparités en fonction des métiers. Les entreprises ayant adopté l’IA pour la gestion administrative ou le marketing ont notamment semblé voir leurs emplois dans ces domaines diminuer. Dans les professions intermédiaires, administratives ou commerciales, des emplois seront menacés par l’automatisation permise par l’IA. Une politique d’adaptation du marché du travail et de formation sera donc nécessaire.\n\n Vis‑à‑vis de la croissance, en se référant à l’élan donné par les révolutions technologiques précédentes, liées à l’électricité ou aux technologies de l’information et de la communication (TIC), on pourrait anticiper une hausse du taux de croissance de l’ordre de 1 % par an sur 10 ans. Certains diront qu’en prenant aussi en compte l’automatisation de la production des idées, un potentiel plus élevé de croissance pourrait être envisagé. D’autres diront au contraire qu’il conviendrait également de prendre en compte un certain nombre de freins et d’obstacles à la croissance, liés notamment à l’absence de concurrence dans les segments en amont de la chaîne de production de l’IA que sont l’accès aux données et l’accès à la puissance de calcul. La révolution des TIC, par exemple, a dopé la croissance aux États‑Unis à la fin des années 1990\\. Cependant, une période de stagnation a ensuite été observée, résultant de l’essor de grands groupes, les GAFAM, ayant fini par inhiber l’entrée sur le marché d’entreprises innovantes. Dans le domaine de l’IA, de grands acteurs, dont les GAFAM, sont déjà présents. Si nous n’adaptons pas notre politique de concurrence, nous risquons d’être confrontés à des obstacles à la croissance.\n\n L’IA représente ainsi un grand potentiel de croissance et de création d’emplois. Pour exploiter ce potentiel et faire pleinement de l’IA un facteur de progrès, il nous faudra toutefois réformer nos institutions et nos politiques publiques, en matière d’éducation, de concurrence, d’adaptation du marché du travail, etc.\n\n L’Europe et la France ont des atouts pour être des acteurs de cette révolution. En France, nous disposons notamment d’excellents mathématiciens et ingénieurs. Un certain nombre de grands acteurs de l’IA, tel Yann Le Cun, sont français. Cependant, pour le moment, ces Français vont souvent travailler ailleurs.\n\n De manière générale, nous n’investissons aujourd’hui pas suffisamment dans l’IA. En proportion du PIB, la France investit actuellement trois fois moins que les États‑Unis dans le domaine. Or, sans investissements majeurs dans l’IA, nous courrons le risque de nous trouver dépourvus d’entreprises spécialisées dans l’IA et de voir nos entreprises des autres secteurs perdre en compétitivité.\n\n Jusqu’à présent, nous avons engagé dans l’IA environ 3 milliards d’euros d’investissements publics sur 8 ans. Notre rapport recommande un investissement de 5 milliards d’euros par an pendant 5 ans. Cet effort ne représenterait que 0,3 % des dépenses publiques totales. Dès lors que celles‑ci sont appelées à augmenter de plus de 200 milliards d’euros en 5 ans, nous considérons cet effort réaliste. Pour financer l’investissement dans l’IA, l’enjeu ne serait pas tant de supprimer des dépenses publiques, mais de choisir les dépenses publiques à faire croître plus rapidement.\n\n Je rejoindrai en ce sens la doctrine développée par Mario Draghi, consistant à ne pas mettre sur le même plan toutes les dépenses publiques. Il y a des dépenses publiques de fonctionnement, récurrentes. À cet égard, il fallait faire la réforme des retraites. D’autres réformes de l’État apparaissent également nécessaires. En parallèle, il y a aussi des dépenses publiques d’investissement dans la croissance et l’environnement. Investir dans l’IA, c’est investir dans la croissance qui nous permettra, plus tard, de rembourser la dette publique.\n\nMme Anne Bouverot. – Nous avons formulé 25 recommandations. Je reviendrai sur 7 d’entre elles, qui nous paraissent particulièrement importantes.\n\n La première serait de créer les conditions d’une appropriation collective de l’IA, en lançant un plan de sensibilisation et de formation à l’échelle de la nation. Dans le cadre de la révolution de l’IA, au‑delà des métiers à risque et des métiers à créer, beaucoup de tâches et de métiers sont appelés à se transformer. Il conviendra donc d’agir sur la formation continue. Il faudra également former davantage de personnes à l’IA dans le cadre de la formation initiale, en veillant à associer l’IA aux grands domaines de formation : droit, histoire, finance, etc. Nous aurons également besoin d’un plan de sensibilisation de tous les citoyens et tous les élèves, dès l’école maternelle, à la compréhension des enjeux de l’IA, par exemple pour développer chez eux un esprit critique face aux images générées par l’IA, dans une optique de lutte contre la désinformation.\n\n La deuxième recommandation serait d’investir massivement dans les entreprises du numérique et dans la transformation des entreprises, quelle que soit leur taille, pour soutenir l’écosystème français et préserver sa compétitivité. Pour ce faire, la proposition serait de créer un fonds dédié « France et IA ».\n\n La troisième recommandation serait de faire de la France et de l’Europe un pôle majeur de la puissance de calcul, à court et à moyen termes. L’IA et les grands modèles de langage reposent sur énormément de puissance de calcul et de données. Le sujet de la puissance de calcul est donc fondamental.\n\n La quatrième recommandation serait de transformer notre approche de la donnée personnelle, pour pouvoir à la fois continuer à protéger nos concitoyens, en confortant le rôle de la Cnil et du RGPD, tout en étant capables de soutenir l’innovation au bénéfice de tous, dans le domaine de la santé notamment.\n\n La cinquième recommandation serait, dans le cadre du développement de l’IA dans le domaine de la culture et des industries créatives, d’assurer le rayonnement de la culture française, pour éviter que les modèles d’IA soient entraînés principalement sur des données et de la culture anglo-saxonnes. À cet égard, les données de l’Institut national de l’audiovisuel (INA) représentent déjà 100 fois plus que les données du common crawl utilisé pour l’entraînement des modèles et résultant du balayage de l’internet. Ces données ont une valeur quantitative et qualitative importante, qu’il faut mobiliser.\n\n La sixième recommandation serait de conduire une expérimentation dans le domaine de la recherche publique autour de l’IA, pour améliorer les conditions de travail de nos chercheurs et éviter une fuite de nos talents, notamment vers les grandes entreprises américaines, celles‑ci offrant aujourd’hui des conditions de travail et de rémunération incomparables.\n\n Enfin, la septième recommandation serait de structurer une initiative diplomatique internationale cohérente pour promouvoir une gouvernance mondiale de l’IA. À cet égard, l’accueil par la France du prochain sommet mondial de l’IA pourrait représenter une opportunité.\n\n Au‑delà de ces recommandations, nous sommes convaincus que notre capacité à nous différencier dans le domaine de l’IA dépendra de notre capacité à prendre aussi en compte les enjeux environnementaux associés. Il nous faudra faire preuve de transparence vis‑à‑vis des impacts environnementaux de l’IA et favoriser le développement de solutions et de modèles d’IA portant une attention spécifique à ces enjeux : consommation énergétique, consommation d’eau, frugalité, etc.\n\nM. David Ros, sénateur, vice-président de l’Office. – J’ai eu l’occasion de demander au Gouvernement si les hauts fonctionnaires de Bercy avaient utilisé l’IA pour mesurer l’impact dans la durée des coupes budgétaires annoncées, dans la recherche et l’enseignement supérieur notamment – les investissements dans ce domaine rejoignant les dépenses vertueuses évoquées par Philippe Aghion. Je n’ai toutefois pas obtenu de réponse.\n\n Vous avez par ailleurs évoqué le retard en investissements dans l’IA de la France par rapport aux États‑Unis, en pourcentage du PIB. Pourriez‑vous cependant détailler ce retard en distinguant l’investissement public de l’investissement privé ?\n\n Se pose par ailleurs la question du bénéfice de la croissance générée par l’IA. Où en est‑on des réflexions sur la rétribution de ceux qui participent à cette croissance par leurs données, au‑delà des questions déontologiques, ou par la mise à disposition de leur puissance de calcul ? Ceci pose également, en toile de fond, la question de la souveraineté numérique de la France et de l’Europe.\n\nMme Sonia de La Provôté, sénatrice. – Un rapport récent de l’Académie nationale de médecine a soulevé un enjeu de supervision humaine de l’usage de l’IA dans le domaine de la santé. Dans votre rapport, cette dimension de protection semble constituer un frein. Toutefois, ce frein sera d’autant moins important que nous l’anticiperons, tant sur le plan éthique que sur le plan juridique, en considérant les enjeux liés à la protection des patients, à la responsabilité du corps médical, à la formation des professionnels de santé, etc.\n\n Dans le domaine de la culture, au‑delà de la langue d’expression des modèles d’IA, il nous faudra aussi considérer la protection de notre terreau culturel, de notre histoire culturelle, de nos manières de penser et de nos artistes auteurs. L’IA progressant très rapidement dans le domaine de la culture, il nous faudra considérer les gains économiques associés, mais aussi les pertes économiques, culturelles et démocratiques à prévenir pour nos concitoyens. Il y a aujourd’hui une forme d’urgence à traiter ces questions.\n\nM. Alexandre Sabatou, député. – Vous avez salué dans votre rapport une augmentation, en France, des investissements en capital-risque dans l’IA. Cependant, ceux‑ci demeurent très faibles par rapport à ceux observés aux États‑Unis. Comment encourager l’investissement à long terme dans les entreprises françaises, au‑delà de l’investissement public qui ne peut répondre seul aux enjeux soulevés par l’IA ?\n\n Par ailleurs, l’investissement public que vous préconisez, à hauteur de 25 milliards d’euros sur 5 ans, sera‑t‑il suffisant pour lutter contre la domination des GAFAM – la société OpenAI étant aujourd’hui valorisée à plus de 100 milliards d’euros ?\n\n Enfin, votre rapport met l’accent sur la souveraineté européenne. La France apparaît certes petite pour rivaliser avec les GAFAM, les États‑Unis ou la Chine. Avez‑vous néanmoins identifié des limites dans cette coopération entre les États à l’échelle européenne ? Certaines dimensions ne devraient‑elles pas demeurer franco-françaises, autour de la gestion des données notamment ?\n\nMme Anne Bouverot. – Nous accusons, de fait, un retard par rapport aux États‑Unis dans les investissements dans l’IA, tant sur le volet public que sur le volet privé. Les stratégies recommandées par le rapport Villani de 2018 et mises en œuvre via France 2030 ont consisté à investir 3 milliards d’euros sur 8 ans. L’investissement public à hauteur de 5 milliards d’euros par an sur 5 ans que nous recommandons serait donc significatif. En parallèle, nous recommandons la constitution d’un fonds « France et IA », doté d’une gouvernance publique-privée, pour encourager aussi l’investissement privé. Aux États‑Unis, la recherche publique est ainsi achetée par les entreprises privées. La chercheuse Fei‑Fei Li a récemment interpellé Joe Biden à ce sujet à l’occasion de son discours sur l’état de l’Union.\n\n Dans le domaine de la santé, la protection des données demeure effectivement extrêmement importante. La proposition serait de conserver le rôle de la Cnil dans cette protection, tout en lui confiant, avec des ressources supplémentaires, un rôle dans le domaine de l’innovation. La Cnil, que nous avons auditionnée, est appelée à répondre à de plus en plus de questions autour de l’IA. Elle aura donc un rôle extrêmement important à jouer, y compris pour donner de la visibilité en amont aux entreprises et aux organisations, pour qu’elles puissent innover et déployer leurs services liés à l’IA en anticipant les éventuelles difficultés associées. Concrètement, dans le domaine de la santé, une autorisation préalable est aujourd’hui obligatoire pour l’utilisation de données dans une optique de recherche et de développement de solutions au bénéfice des patients. Nous estimons que cette autorisation préalable pourrait être supprimée, au profit d’une logique de responsabilisation des acteurs et de validation ex post. À défaut, le risque serait que ces solutions continuent d’être développées par d’autres et que nous soyons amenés, pour répondre à des enjeux de santé, à retenir des innovations ne provenant majoritairement pas d’acteurs français.\n\n Dans le domaine de la culture, il apparaît effectivement important, au‑delà du rayonnement de la culture et des valeurs françaises et européennes, d’assurer le respect du droit d’auteur. À cet égard, il existe, dans la règlementation européenne, des capacités d’opt‑in et d’opt‑out à la disposition des artistes et auteurs. Nous recommandons une transparence sur ces dispositions, pour qu’elles puissent être mobilisées de manière plus éclairée. Il subsiste toutefois un risque d’évitement. C’est pourquoi nous recommandons également le développement d’une plateforme de mise en relation des ayants droit avec les sociétés d’IA, pour leur permettre de négocier, le cas échéant de manière collective, l’utilisation et la rémunération de leurs créations.\n\n Pour ce qui est de la souveraineté, nous avons beaucoup placé la réflexion au niveau européen, car les montants financiers à engager sont considérables. La France est sans doute le pays européen souhaitant le plus conserver sa souveraineté nationale. Cependant, elle doit aussi faire preuve de pragmatisme, en considérant ses capacités à faire. Il conviendra de s’interroger sur les données à conserver impérativement en France, sur des serveurs français, ainsi que sur les données qu’il ne serait pas viable économiquement d’exploiter ainsi et vis‑à‑vis desquelles une réflexion pourrait être menée à l’échelle européenne ou avec d’autres acteurs internationaux.\n\nM. Philippe Aghion. – Les externalités de croissance justifient un investissement public dans l’IA. De surcroît, si nous ne faisons rien, nous serons confrontés à deux dangers : nous risquons d’être dépourvus d’entreprises spécialisées dans l’IA et de voir nos entreprises existantes perdre en compétitivité. Aucun secteur n’est à l’abri des transformations liées à l’IA. Par le passé, les pays s’étant tenus à l’écart d’une révolution technologique ont été déclassés au plan économique et dominés au plan géopolitique. Si nous n’investissons pas suffisamment dans l’IA, nous risquons donc d’être perdants, alors même que nous disposons de talents et d’atouts formidables.\n\n L’idée serait cependant de promouvoir un partenariat public-privé. Les chemins de fer ont été construits ainsi en France. L’idée ne serait donc pas de tout renvoyer à l’investissement public. Le fonds que nous recommandons pour financer l’émergence d’un écosystème autour de l’IA et la transformation numérique de l’ensemble du tissu économique et des services publics français serait doté de 10 milliards d’euros, dont 3 milliards d’euros de capitaux publics et 7 milliards de capitaux privés. Ce levier de financement par le secteur privé aurait vocation à mobiliser principalement les grandes entreprises – la France ne disposant pas, au contraire des États‑Unis, d’investisseurs institutionnels de type fonds de pension. La politique industrielle moderne est ainsi faite. L’investissement public a vocation à entraîner, en préservant la concurrence et l’open source, l’investissement privé. La DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) et la BARDA (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Agency) ont ainsi joué leur rôle aux États‑Unis dans les secteurs de la défense et des vaccins.\n\n Pour ce qui est de la protection des données, la logique de contrôle du RGPD est aujourd’hui largement ex post, tandis que celle de la Cnil demeure ex ante (avec un régime d’autorisation préalable). Tout en renforçant le rôle de la Cnil, l’idée serait d’aller davantage vers une logique ex post, dans le domaine de la santé notamment, pour dynamiser la recherche et l’innovation en santé. Nous disposons en France de formidables données de santé, de formidables chercheurs et d’un corps médical extraordinaire. Nous pourrions donc être les meilleurs dans ce domaine.\n\nM. Arnaud Bazin, sénateur. – Vous avez formulé des recommandations autour de la puissance de calcul et du stockage massif de données. Ces capacités conditionnent une grande partie des enjeux de sécurité et de souveraineté évoqués. Quelle part des investissements devra y être consacrée ? Selon quels modèles ? Avec quelle articulation public‑privé ? Comment développer rapidement ces capacités massives, qui constituaient déjà un enjeu avant l’accélération du développement de l’IA ?\n\n Se pose également la question de la dépendance de l’IA à l’égard d’autres technologies : liaisons satellitaires pour guider les véhicules, débit et couverture du réseau de fibres optiques pour interroger les services dématérialisés, etc. Avez‑vous exploré ces zones de fragilité ou de risque ?\n\nMme Martine Berthet, sénatrice. – Dans le cadre du développement de l’IA, nous savons que l’anglais risque de prendre le dessus. Ce risque est‑il réel ? Si oui, comment protéger nos langues, notamment la langue française, pour laquelle nous nous battons déjà ?\n\nM. Bernard Fialaire, sénateur. – Vous avez évoqué certains de nos domaines d’excellence, parmi lesquels les mathématiques et la santé. Cependant, en matière d’éducation, comment accompagner le développement de l’IA ? Au‑delà du renforcement de l’enseignement des mathématiques, des enseignements spécifiques devront‑ils être introduits ? Si oui, comment les diffuser et à quel rythme ?\n\nMme Anne Bouverot. – La puissance de calcul est effectivement très importante. La responsable technique d’OpenAI, Mira Murati, m’indiquait récemment que, face au succès inimaginable de ChatGPT, elle avait dû solliciter immédiatement auprès de Microsoft un autre supercomputer. La logique des modèles de langage est ainsi de s’appuyer sur des puissances de calcul considérables. Il est donc essentiel que nous puissions donner aux chercheurs et aux entreprises, en France et en Europe, un accès à des puissances de calcul importantes, tout en essayant de développer des approches alternatives, à travers l’open source, la mutualisation des capacités, le développement de modèles plus performants et moins gourmands, etc. À cet égard, une gouvernance internationale nécessiterait d’être promue, y compris pour pouvoir, le cas échéant, solliciter une contribution sociétale auprès de grands acteurs du cloud. Une attention devra également d’être portée à l’innovation – les nouveaux modèles de Nvidia étant déjà appelés à multiplier la puissance de calcul avec une consommation énergétique moindre.\n\n S’agissant de défendre la culture, les valeurs et la langue françaises, les rencontres de la francophonie de l’automne 2024 constitueront une étape importante dans la préparation du prochain sommet mondial de l’IA. De fait, il sera important de veiller à ce que des modèles de langage soient entraînés dans la langue française. Des approches similaires sont d’ores et déjà mises en œuvre en Asie.\n\n En matière d’éducation, au‑delà du renforcement de l’enseignement en mathématiques, en informatique ou en physique, l’enjeu sera d’attirer davantage de femmes et de filles dans les filières scientifiques. Aujourd’hui, les femmes et les filles ont encore trop tendance à se désélectionner d’elles‑mêmes de ces filières. Leurs choix demeurent également guidés par une recherche de sens dans leur métier. Il conviendra donc aussi de mettre en évidence que les métiers de l’informatique et de l’IA permettent le développement de l’innovation en santé, dans les domaines de l’éducation, de l’environnement, etc.\n\nM. Philippe Aghion. – Pour développer des capacités de calcul, il demeure nécessaire de produire des semi‑conducteurs. Cette filière est aujourd’hui extrêmement concentrée, à Taiwan notamment. Cela ne constitue toutefois pas une fatalité. L’Europe et la France doivent se positionner vis‑à‑vis des prochaines générations de semi‑conducteurs. Au regard de l’ampleur des investissements nécessaires, l’intervention de la puissance publique apparaît indispensable. Il s’agit d’un enjeu de souveraineté et de compétitivité.\n\n En matière de formation, nous recommandons une sensibilisation, dès la petite école, aux bons et mauvais usages de l’IA. Nous préconisons également le développement d’actions de sensibilisation auprès du grand public, au travers de « cafés IA », de débats, etc. En parallèle, l’enjeu sera d’introduire de l’IA dans tous les domaines d’enseignement et de formation. Des spécialistes de l’IA devront également être formés pour déployer l’IA dans les entreprises et les administrations. Une articulation devra être trouvée entre ces trois niveaux.\n\n Je souhaiterais également aborder la question de la concurrence. La politique industrielle et la politique de concurrence sont souvent opposées. La politique de concurrence empêche souvent toute aide sectorielle d’état ; la politique industrielle écarte quant à elle souvent le développement de la concurrence. Or ces deux politiques doivent être articulées. Certains secteurs ou segments sont aujourd’hui dominés par un faible nombre d’acteurs, ce qui plombe la croissance. Le cloud est ainsi dominé par Amazon, Google et Microsoft. Il nous faut donc agir sur la concurrence. Le Digital Market Act (DMA) vise aujourd’hui à prévenir les abus de position dominante. Ce dispositif nécessiterait d’être complété et étendu, pour couvrir l’ensemble de la chaîne de valeur de l’IA. L’open source a également vocation à faciliter l’évaluation par des tiers (pour améliorer et sécuriser les modèles), à favoriser la personnalisation des modèles (et donc leur adaptation à différents contextes, linguistiques notamment), à réduire l’empreinte environnementale de l’IA (en évitant que chacun réentraîne son propre modèle de fondation) et à abaisser les barrières à l’entrée (pour permettre l’entrée de nouvelles entreprises et dynamiser la concurrence).\n\nMme Sylvie Vermeillet, sénatrice. – Les bienfaits de l’IA ne sauraient être remis en question. Cependant, vous évoquez aussi un certain nombre de risques. Qu’en est‑il par exemple du risque lié aux deep fake, c’est‑à‑dire du risque d’usurpation d’identité ? Cela va‑t‑il nécessiter une évolution juridique ? Quelles sanctions pour quelle maîtrise ?\n\n Qu’en est‑il du risque de fraude ? Comment adapter les moyens dévolus à nos administrations, dans le rapport de force avec les trafiquants et délinquants ?\n\n Quel cadre légal pour l’open source, vis‑à‑vis de l’AI Act ?\n\n Comment articuler, en Europe, le développement par la recherche civile avec celui porté par le domaine militaire, alors que l’Union européenne n’exerce pas, au contraire des États‑Unis ou de la Chine, de compétence en matière militaire ?\n\n Enfin, le développement de l’IA ne risque‑t‑il pas de s’opérer au détriment de l’intelligence de l’Homme ?\n\nMme Pascale Gruny, sénateur. – Nos collectivités territoriales disposent de moyens financiers limités. Notre ruralité est également souvent oubliée, y compris dans le déploiement des technologies. Dans ce contexte, comment faire pour déployer les investissements nécessaires ?\n\n De surcroît, pour faire face à la transformation des emplois induite par l’IA, nos collectivités territoriales ne pourront pas doublonner leurs postes. Là encore, des moyens financiers devront être engagés.\n\n Se posera également, pour les collectivités territoriales, la question de la cybersécurité. Les collectivités territoriales font aujourd’hui l’objet d’attaques régulières. Comment pourront‑elles se protéger ? Cet enjeu apparaît particulièrement important pour les communes qui assurent la gestion de l’état civil.\n\n L’automatisation est par ailleurs appelée à supprimer les emplois de travailleurs peu qualifiés, n’ayant pas nécessairement les moyens de se former. Ne risque‑t‑on pas de laisser de côté ces personnes, que nous retrouvons déjà parmi les bénéficiaires du RSA ?\n\n L’éducation nationale sera‑t‑elle prête ? Au Danemark, les enfants sont déjà sensibilisés au codage dès la maternelle. Où en est‑on en France de l’apprentissage du codage ? Dans cette optique, qu’en est‑il de la formation des enseignants ?\n\n Enfin, dans le monde de l’entreprise, comment adapter la formation professionnelle continue ? Les centres de formation seront‑ils au bon niveau pour accompagner les personnes pouvant prétendre aux emplois liés à l’IA ou devant se former à d’autres emplois ?\n\nMme Anne Ventalon, sénatrice. – L’IA et la production massive de données de santé pourraient être une aide précieuse pour l’innovation en santé et la pratique médicale. Au travers de nos auditions sur les liens entre l’IA et notre système de santé, nous avons pu entrevoir de nombreux domaines d’application. Nous n’en sommes toutefois qu’à un stade expérimental. Quelle est votre analyse des perspectives de transformation par l’IA de notre service public de la santé ? L’IA est‑elle une opportunité pour lutter contre les déserts médicaux et les difficultés d’accès aux soins, dans les départements ruraux notamment ?\n\nMme Ghislaine Senée, sénatrice. – L’IA porte également un important potentiel pour accompagner la transition écologique. Pour cela, il faudra néanmoins investir. Des études ont‑elles été réalisées sur le développement de l’IA dans le contexte du plan national d’adaptation au réchauffement climatique ? Des modélisations ont‑elles été réalisées pour interroger notre capacité à répondre aux objectifs ainsi fixés, en tenant compte des besoins en matière de consommations énergétique, d’eau, de silice, de terres rares, etc. ? La projection faite dans votre rapport est‑elle compatible avec les limites auxquelles nous sommes aujourd’hui confrontés ?\n\n Se pose par ailleurs la question de l’accès à l’IA, qui soulève une problématique de traitement social des données.\n\nM. Alexandre Sabatou, député. – Il est rarement question de hardware, alors que le sujet est fondamental. 6 % de la production des semi‑conducteurs est aujourd’hui localisée en Europe. Nous partons donc de loin. Comment créer une nouvelle filière avec les investissements que vous préconisez, alors que le budget R&D de Nvidia s’est élevé, en 2023, à 7,4 milliards d’euros ? À cet égard, avez‑vous auditionné des représentants de Lite‑On ?\n\nM. Philippe Aghion. – Nous les avons bien auditionnés.\n\nM. Alexandre Sabatou, député. – Quel est par ailleurs votre avis sur l’application en France de l’AI Act ? Alors que vous parlez de simplification administrative, cette règlementation ne risque‑t‑elle pas de contraindre notre action ?\n\nM. Pierre Henriet, député, premier vice-président de l’Office. – Quelle est votre ambition par rapport à la mise en œuvre concrète des recommandations de votre rapport ? Avez‑vous envisagé un pilotage ? Au regard des enjeux, en termes de souveraineté intellectuelle, industrielle et économique, notre pays ne pourra passer à côté du sujet. Nous aurons donc besoin d’une programmation.\n\nMme Anne Bouverot. – Tout en faisant preuve d’un optimisme raisonné, nous avons examiné les risques portés par l’IA. Vis‑à‑vis du deep fake, par exemple, des approches technologiques ou juridiques existent, avec notamment le watermarking permettant de marquer publiquement les vidéos générées par une IA. Il importe également de condamner les usages frauduleux ou antidémocratiques. En parallèle, il apparaît nécessaire de familiariser nos concitoyens avec les risques portés par l’IA. C’est pour cela que nous avons préconisé la mise en œuvre, dès la maternelle et à tous les âges, d’actions de sensibilisation. J’estime qu’il conviendrait par ailleurs de nous doter de lieux de recherche et d’alimentation du débat public autour des risques liés aux usages de l’IA. Un institut « IA et Société » vient d’être créé en ce sens par l’ENS et l’Université Paris Dauphine, en toute indépendance vis‑à‑vis des grands acteurs de la tech.\n\n L’AI Act, quant à lui, a été adopté. Il importe désormais de réfléchir à sa mise en œuvre, pour que celle‑ci soit la plus pertinente et la plus simple possible. Cette mise en œuvre nécessitera une compréhension technique de l’IA. Il conviendra pour cela d’engager des discussions avec des chercheurs et des représentants d’entreprises. Ceci met en évidence l’importance de disposer d’une recherche publique indépendante et de qualité pour accompagner les régulateurs.\n\n Pour ce qui est de l’impact environnemental de l’IA, nous avons regretté de ne pas pouvoir traiter mieux cet enjeu. Il s’agit effectivement d’un sujet majeur. D’une part, il nous faudra considérer l’impact environnemental des infrastructures de calcul et de stockage des données nécessaires au développement de l’utilisation de l’IA, avec des enjeux en termes de consommations énergétique, d’eau et de terres rares, mais aussi d’émissions de carbone. D’autre part, il nous faudra aussi envisager les perspectives d’optimisation, à travers l’IA, de nos consommations et de nos émissions. Il existe aujourd’hui peu de données disponibles concernant ces impacts. Il s’agira néanmoins de faire preuve de transparence à cet égard. Aujourd’hui, les entreprises ou les collectivités considèrent surtout des critères technologiques, d’efficacité et de prix des modèles d’IA. Demain, l’enjeu sera de faire en sorte que leurs choix puissent aussi être guidés par des critères environnementaux. En parallèle, il s’agira d’encourager la recherche et le développement de solutions plus frugales, le cas échéant avec des modèles plus verticaux et plus spécifiques.\n\n Pour ce qui est du pilotage de la mise en œuvre des recommandations de notre rapport, je vous retournerai la question. Comment pourrions‑nous aider le Gouvernement et le Parlement ? Notre commission pourrait‑elle demander à bénéficier d’un travail de suivi, le cas échéant semestriel ? D’autres moyens pourraient‑ils être envisagés ? Votre expérience dans ce domaine nous serait précieuse.\n\nM. Philippe Aghion. – L’IA a vocation à constituer un outil, pour automatiser un certain nombre de tâches rébarbatives et donner davantage de temps à l’humain pour des tâches créatives. Dans ce cadre, certains emplois devront cependant être recyclés. Il faudra donc former et disposer d’un marché du travail bien organisé. Le Danemark dispose déjà, à cet égard, d’un système efficace, avec des dispositifs de formation et de flexisécurité. Du reste, en France, l’IA pourrait également jouer un rôle dans l’amélioration du dialogue social.\n\n Une réforme de l’éducation apparaît par ailleurs nécessaire. Les Portugais ont ainsi réussi à améliorer leurs résultats dans le cadre des enquêtes PISA. De fait, le développement de l’IA imposera de renforcer l’enseignement des mathématiques et d’envisager la manière de rendre les mathématiques concrètes.\n\n Vis‑à‑vis du climat et des problématiques environnementales, l’IA pourrait être une solution pour optimiser les consommations d’eau, d’énergie et d’intrants. Elle pourrait également accompagner l’innovation verte des entreprises et réduire le coût de leur transition. Néanmoins, il est évident que l’IA est aussi appelée à générer des consommations importantes. À cet égard, l’innovation aura également un rôle important à jouer. Du reste, le rapport entre IA et environnement nécessiterait sans doute un rapport en soi.\n\n Pour le pilotage de la mise en œuvre des recommandations de notre rapport, nous aurons besoin de vous. Certains sujets nécessiteraient de faire l’objet, en France, d’une véritable union nationale. Le grand risque serait de passer à côté de l’IA, au détriment de notre influence sur la scène internationale, alors même que nous avons de formidables atouts. Nous souhaitons tous que la France soit grande. À cet égard, l’IA nécessiterait donc d’être, à l’instar du domaine militaire, un sujet d’union nationale, investi par le Président de la République, le Parlement et l’ensemble des partis politiques, pour faire en sorte que les objectifs fixés soient poursuivis avec constance dans la durée, par‑delà les alternances ou les divergences politiques.\n\nMme Christine Lavarde, sénateur, présidente de la délégation à la prospective. – Toutes les sensibilités politiques du Sénat travaillent aujourd’hui sur ce sujet, au sein de l’OPECST comme au sein de la délégation à la prospective et de la délégation aux collectivités territoriales.\n\n Dans notre rôle de législateur, il nous appartient de voter la loi, mais aussi de contrôler et d’évaluer son application. Vous pourrez également, en tant que Commission de l’intelligence artificielle, vous intéresser aux suites données à votre rapport.\n\n Merci à toutes et tous pour votre participation à cette audition.\n\nLa réunion est close à 19 h 35. \n\nMembres présents ou excusés \n\nOffice parlementaire d’évaluation des choix scientifiques et technologiques \n\n Réunion du mardi 26 mars 2024 à 18 heures\n\n Députés\n\nPrésents. - M.
